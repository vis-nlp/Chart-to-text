Both black and Hispanic respondents were more likely than whites to say they feel they need to stay tuned in to news about the coronavirus outbreak . Roughly four-in-ten black adults said this ( 39 % ) , as did 36 % of Hispanics . Around a quarter of white adults ( 23 % ) said the same . Still , majorities in all three groups said they need to take breaks from this news from time to time ( 76 % of white , 63 % of Hispanic and 60 % of black adults ) .
When it comes to the 18 % of teachers who took a second job during the 2015 - 16 school year , there were no major differences by age or teaching experience level . But there were differences by gender : During the school year , roughly a quarter ( 26 % ) of male teachers had a second job , compared with 15 % of female teachers . ( The pattern was similar for the previous summer , when 24 % of male teachers had a second job , versus 13 % of female teachers . )
The collapse of Utah 's Crandall Canyon Mine that trapped six mine workers and led to a major rescue effort topped the public 's news interest last week . Overall , nearly three-in-ten Americans ( 28 % ) said it was the story they followed more closely than any other . The coal mining accident shared the public 's attention for the most closely followed story of the week with the war in Iraq ( 16 % most closely ) and the 2008 presidential campaign ( 11 % ) . U.S. economic conditions ( 9 % ) , hot weather ( 8 % ) , and the Barry Bonds record ( 7 % ) each was cited by fewer than one-in-ten Americans .
German reticence about taking on more international burdens can be seen in public attitudes toward greater sharing of the global security burden . Asked if Germany should play a more active military role in helping to maintain peace and stability in the world , only 25 % of Germans agree . Just over two-thirds ( 69 % ) believe that , given its history , Germany should limit its military role in world affairs .
When asked about various topics of campaign coverage , two areas stand out for being over-covered : About four-in-ten say there is too much coverage of candidates ' comments on the campaign trail ( 44 % ) and of their personal lives ( 43 % ) , higher than any other topics asked about . This is followed by coverage of which candidate is leading in the polls ( 37 % ) and the candidates ' moral character ( 30 % ) . Very few say the candidates ' experience ( 15 % ) or their stances on issues ( 13 % ) have received too much attention .
Roughly two-thirds of Latino registered voters ( 68 % ) say they are fearful about the state of the nation . Meanwhile , 45 % of Latino voters say they are hopeful . These views are similar to those reported in June , and similar to those among U.S. voters overall . Latino voters across demographic groups express similar levels of fear when thinking about the state of the country . By contrast , levels of hope for the country among Latino voters vary by gender and education levels . About half of Hispanic men registered to vote ( 51 % ) say they feel hopeful about the state of the country , compared with only 36 % of Hispanic women voters . Meanwhile , 37 % of Hispanic voters with a bachelor 's degree or more say the feel hopeful , while 47 % of Hispanic voters with some college experience or less say the same .
On one hand , Americans continued to support the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , at least in principle , but had concerns about its scope and implementation . A Gallup poll in October 1964 reported that the public approved of the new law by nearly two-to-one ( 58 % to 31 % ) . And in April 1965 , Gallup found a whopping 76 % in favor of a then-proposed equal rights voting law .
Russia 's power and influence is seen as a major threat by a median of four-in-ten across the continent , about the same share that sees U.S. power and influence as a threat ( median of 37 % ) . Meanwhile , only 35 % see the condition of the global economy as a major threat , as European countries have mostly recovered from the Great Recession and subsequent euro crisis . A median of 31 % see China as a major threat .
As has been the case throughout his presidency , U.S. President Donald Trump receives largely negative reviews from publics around the world . Across 32 countries surveyed by Pew Research Center , a median of 64 % say they do not have confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs , while just 29 % express confidence in the American leader .
India 's massive population includes not only the vast majority of the world 's Hindus , but also the second-largest group of Muslims within a single country , behind only Indonesia . By 2050 , India 's Muslim population will grow to 311 million , making it the largest Muslim population in the world , according to Pew Research Center projections . Still , Indian Muslims are projected to remain a minority in their country , making up about 18 % of the total population at midcentury , while Hindus figure to remain a majority ( about 77 % ) .
Moreover , a plurality of Indians characterize Lashkar-e-Taiba , the group widely blamed for the Mumbai attacks , as the greatest threat facing their country . One-third name Pakistan as the greatest threat – and overwhelmingly Indians believe there is a link between these two threats : 58 % say the Pakistani government actively supports extremist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba , while another 21 % think it at least tolerates them . And if these groups were to conduct another terrorist attack against India , most would support military action against them in Pakistan .
While there is not clear majority support among either party for this , Democrats and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party are more likely than their Republican and Republican-leaning counterparts to believe that the government should have a role in providing these services . Roughly half of Democrats ( 52 % ) say the federal government has a responsibility to ensure that all Americans have a high-speed internet connection at home during the COVID-19 outbreak , while just 22 % of Republicans hold his view . Democrats are also about twice as likely as Republicans to believe the federal government has responsibility to provide cellphone service for all Americans amid this crisis ( 45 % vs. 21 % ) .
Trump 's overall job approval has changed little since the beginning of his presidency . Currently , 55 % of Americans disapprove of his job as president , while 40 % approve . While men are evenly split in their views of Trump 's job performance ( 47 % approve , 47 % disapprove ) , women are far more likely to disapprove ( 63 % ) than approve ( 32 % ) . Large majorities of blacks ( 84 % ) disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job ; whites continue to be divided over Trump 's job performance ( 50 % approve , 46 % disapprove ) . By contrast , black Protestants and the religiously unaffiliated overwhelmingly disapprove of how Trump is handling his job as president ( 87 % and 67 % , respectively ) . White mainline Protestants are divided ( 49 % approve , 47 % disapprove ) .
By comparison , assessments are less positive among Cubans and Puerto Ricans . Among Cubans , 38 % say the impact of unauthorized immigration is positive , but 28 % say the impact is negative and 27 % say there is no impact one way or the other . Among Puerto Ricans , roughly equal shares say the impact of unauthorized immigration on U.S. Hispanics is positive ( 34 % ) , negative ( 29 % ) or has no effect ( 29 % ) . Spanish-dominant Hispanics are positive about the impact of unauthorized immigrants on the Hispanic community with 55 % saying their impact is positive . By contrast , opinions are split among English-dominant Hispanics—31 % see a positive effect of unauthorized immigration , 30 % see a negative effect and 33 % say there is no impact one way or the other . Educational attainment is also linked to views of unauthorized immigration 's effect on Latinos already living in the U.S. Half ( 52 % ) of Latinos who have less than a high school diploma and half ( 48 % ) of Latinos who are high school graduates say the impact of unauthorized immigration on U.S. Latinos is positive . By contrast , among Latinos with a bachelor 's degree , views are not as positive . Just one-third ( 34 % ) say the effect of unauthorized immigration is positive , 33 % say it is negative and 27 % say there has been no effect .2
Overwhelming majorities of Americans say cooperation with other countries is important when dealing with each of the international issues tested , and this is especially true of the spread of infectious diseases . On this issue , 86 % say it is very important to cooperate with other countries , and 97 % say it is at least somewhat important to cooperate .
Democrats and Republicans also differ over so-called `` no excuse '' absentee or early voting , according to a separate survey conducted in June . Overall , 65 % of U.S. adults said voters should be allowed to vote early or absentee without a documented reason , but Democrats were nearly twice as likely as Republicans to hold this view ( 83 % vs. 44 % ) . Among the one-third of Americans who said early or absentee voting should be allowed only with a documented reason , Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to say COVID-19 should not be considered a valid reason .
Today , 38 % of Republicans say they are excited and 48 % are relieved that Trump won , while 13 % say they are disappointed . In pre-election surveys , fewer Republicans anticipated they would feel excited about a Trump victory , while greater shares expected they would feel disappointed .
Medians of nearly two-thirds say terrorism ( 66 % ) and cyberattacks ( 65 % ) pose major threats to their country , while roughly six-in-ten ( 61 % ) say the same about the spread of nuclear weapons . In nine countries , those on the ideological right are more likely than those on the left to say that terrorism is a major threat to their country .
Roughly a quarter of U.S. adults ( 24 % ) turn to social media posts from either the Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump campaigns as a way of keeping up with the election , according to a new Pew Research Center survey conducted June 7 to July 5 , 2016 . This exceeds the portions that rely on the candidates ' campaign websites ( 10 % ) or their emails ( 9 % ) . Overall , three-in-ten Americans get election news from at least one of these three online sources for news about the election .
Among the 15 Western European countries we surveyed , six have mandatory taxes for members of the largest churches to help finance their activities – Austria , Denmark , Finland , Germany , Sweden and Switzerland . While most registered Christians ( and in some countries , members of other religious groups ) in these countries are required to pay the tax , they have the option of not paying by deregistering from their church . The same basic pattern holds true for levels of religious observance . A minority of adults in church tax countries say they attend worship services monthly or more , with the highest shares in Austria ( 30 % ) , Switzerland ( 29 % ) and Germany ( 24 % ) . That 's roughly in line with the share of people who say this in countries without a church tax , with Ireland ( 37 % ) , France ( 22 % ) and the UK ( 20 % ) topping that list .
These differences are reflected as well in opinions about negative traits associated with Muslims . Roughly eight-in-ten Spanish ( 83 % ) and Germans ( 78 % ) say they associate Muslims with being fanatical . But that view is less prevalent in France ( 50 % ) , Great Britain ( 48 % ) and the U.S. ( 43 % ) . Moreover , while publics in largely Muslim countries generally view Westerners as violent and immoral , this view is not nearly as prevalent among Muslims in France , Spain and Germany . British Muslims however , are the most critical of the four minority publics studied – and they come closer to views of Muslims around the world in their opinions of Westerners .
Though the president 's favorability ratings have improved over the last year , Michelle Obama remains more popular than her husband : Nearly three-quarters of the public ( 72 % ) also have a very ( 46 % ) or mostly ( 25 % ) favorable opinion of the first lady , compared with 22 % who view her unfavorably . Views of Michelle Obama have changed only modestly over the course of eight years , though the share who see her favorably is up 11 points from last year .
Our Christmas survey also asked what people look forward to the most about Christmas . A majority ( 69 % ) say they look forward to spending time with family and friends . A smaller number say they look forward to the religious elements of the holiday ( 11 % ) . By comparison , 4 % cite giving or exchanging gifts , and 1 % mention shopping .
An overwhelming majority of Americans ( 82 % ) support having a school-based requirement that healthy children be vaccinated for measles , mumps and rubella . Older adults , ages 65 and older , are especially strong in their support for requiring the MMR vaccine . Seniors , ages 65 and older , support a school-based requirement for the MMR vaccine by a margin of 90 % to 8 % who say that parents should be able to decide this . Smaller majorities of younger age groups support a school requirement for the MMR vaccine . Parents of young children , parents of school-age children and those with no minor age children hold roughly similar views on this issue , with a majority of all three groups saying that healthy schoolchildren should be required to be vaccinated because of the health risk to others when children are not vaccinated . Some 77 % of parents with children ages 0 to 4 say that healthy children should be required to be vaccinated for the MMR because of the potential health risk to others when children are not vaccinated , while 22 % of this group says parents should be able to decide not to have their children vaccinated even if that creates health risks for others .
But there are wide partisan gaps in these views – with Republicans much more confident than Democrats in the fairness and accessibility of the election . While three-quarters of Republicans and Republican leaners say they are at least somewhat confident the upcoming election will be conducted fairly and accurately , just 46 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners say the same ( with a majority saying they are not too or not at all confident in this ) . The partisan gap is even wider when it comes to ballot access . Nearly nine-in-ten Republicans express at least some confidence that `` all citizens who want to vote in the election will be able to '' – including 41 % who say they are very confident about this . By comparison , just 43 % of Democrats say they are at least somewhat confident all citizens who want to vote will be able to do so , while 56 % say they are not too or not at all confident about this . Among Democrats , confidence that the presidential election in November will be conducted fairly and accurately varies by ideology as well as by race and ethnicity . About half of conservative and moderate Democrats ( 52 % ) say they are either somewhat or very confident that the election will be conducted fairly and accurately , compared with 37 % of liberal Democrats who say this . Similarly , while about half of conservative and moderate Democrats ( 53 % ) are somewhat or very confident that all citizens who want to vote will be able to do , 31 % of liberals hold this view .
As with his overall job rating , Trump engenders strong feelings on taxes : 42 % are `` not at all confident '' that he can make wise decisions on taxes , which is much higher than the shares expressing no confidence in Republican leaders ( 31 % ) or Democratic leaders ( 24 % ) . On the other hand , far more say they are `` very confident '' in Trump ( 22 % ) than say that about GOP leaders ( 9 % ) or Democratic leaders ( 11 % ) .
On social media , too , most people are gravitating toward social activities over political , religious or commercial ones . Among the minority of sub-Saharan Africans who use social media ( ranging from 43 % in South Africa to 20 % in Tanzania ) , more say they share their views on entertainment-related topics like music , movies and sports than say they post about politics , religion or products they enjoy .
Our poll also asked parents to rate the job they were doing raising their children . In general , we found that those who gave themselves high ratings as parents were among the most likely to say they were very happy with their life . The reverse was true , too .
1 Shares of Orthodox Christians have risen sharply across the region , while shares of Catholics have declined . The percentage of Russians who identify as Orthodox Christians has risen substantially since the end of the USSR , from 37 % in 1991 to 71 % in the new survey . Consequently , the share of Russians who describe their religious identity as atheist , agnostic or `` nothing in particular '' has fallen . And the trend is not limited to Russia . Similar patterns are evident in Ukraine and Bulgaria . At the same time , historically Catholic countries in Central and Eastern Europe have undergone a shift in the opposite direction : The Catholic share of the population in Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic has declined at least modestly since 1991 .
Among the seven nations surveyed , Greeks and Italians express particularly negative views about immigration . Eight-in-ten or more in both countries want less immigration , as do majorities in France and the UK . Public opinion is more closely divided in Spain , Germany and Poland , between those who want fewer immigrants admitted to their countries and those who say current levels should stay about the same . However , there is very little desire for allowing more immigrants in any of these seven nations – the percentage who hold this view ranges from 14 % in Germany to only 1 % in Greece .
Majority continues to say that Americans can solve problems . Despite the pandemic and the grim national mood , a majority of adults ( 57 % ) continue to say that , as Americans , we can always find ways to solve our problems and get what we want . This is essentially unchanged since September 2019 , when 55 % expressed optimism in the country 's ability to solve its problems . Republicans are somewhat more likely than Democrats to say that Americans can always find ways to solve our problems . Nearly two-thirds of Republicans say this ( 65 % ) , compared with half of Democrats .
Strikingly , Muslim Americans are far more satisfied with the way things are going in the country ( 56 % ) than is the general public ( 23 % ) . Four years ago , Muslim Americans and the public rendered fairly similar judgments about the state of the nation ( 38 % of Muslims vs. 32 % of the general public were satisfied ) .
Whites are divided in their views of the level of attention paid to race and racial issues : While 36 % think there is too much , about as many ( 38 % ) say there is too little . By contrast , fully 68 % of blacks say there is too little attention paid to race today ; just 15 % say there is too much . A 55 % majority of Hispanics also say there is too little attention on race .
Landline phones do not show these differences in frequency of use by age – older and younger teens are just about as likely to talk every day . If anything , landline phone use shows a slight increase during the mid-teen years ( ages 14 - 16 ) and then drops off again as teens near the end of high school . Face to face conversations outside of school rise modestly with age , from 22 % of 12 year olds having them daily to 38 % of 17 year-olds reporting daily face-to-face interactions outside of school . Nevertheless , this increase by age pales in comparison to the growth in daily mobile phone conversations from age 12 - 17 among cell phone users .
About seven-in-ten Americans ( 72 % ) believe that all , almost all or most of what they do online or while using a cellphone is being tracked by advertisers , technology firms or other companies , according to the June 2019 survey . Close to half of Americans ( 47 % ) said the same about their online activities being tracked by the government .
In fact , Republicans and independents who lean to the GOP are just as likely as Democrats and independents who lean to the Democratic Party to say that , overall , the benefits of the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine outweigh the risks ( 89 % and 88 % respectively ) .
Overall ratings of Iran remain largely negative across much of the world . Solid majorities in the United States and the European Union have an unfavorable opinion of Iran , including more than eight-in-ten people in Germany ( 91 % ) , France ( 86 % ) , Italy ( 85 % ) and Spain ( 84 % ) .
In general , Republicans and Democrats ascribe positive traits to their own party , while holding negative views of the opposing party . For example , about two-thirds of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents ( 66 % ) say their party has high ethical standards , while about the same share of Republicans and Republican leaners ( 64 % ) say the same about the GOP . Comparable shares in each party ( 24 % of Democrats , 21 % of Republicans ) say the opposing party has high ethical standards .
Around 337,000 immigrants were deported from the U.S. in fiscal 2018 , up since 2017 . Overall , the Obama administration deported about 3 million immigrants between 2009 and 2016 , a significantly higher number than the 2 million immigrants deported by the Bush administration between 2001 and 2008 . In 2017 , the Trump administration deported 295,000 immigrants , the lowest total since 2006 . Immigrants convicted of a crime made up the less than half of deportations in 2018 , the most recent year for which statistics by criminal status are available . Of the 337,000 immigrants deported in 2018 , some 44 % had criminal convictions and 56 % were not convicted of a crime . From 2001 to 2018 , a majority ( 60 % ) of immigrants deported have not been convicted of a crime .
In the case of ride-hailing apps , like Uber and Lyft , proponents of these services often argue that they can help promote racial equity in transportation – for instance , they might serve customers in lower-income or minority neighborhoods where traditional taxis are often scarce . Overall , 15 % of blacks and 18 % of Latinos have used ride-hailing , similar to the 14 % of whites who have done so , according to a Pew Research Center survey exploring the digital economy . And a new analysis of this survey data finds that Americans who live in majority-minority communities ( census-block groups where more than 50 % of residents are racial or ethnic minorities ) are more likely than those who reside in predominately white neighborhoods to say that ride-hailing apps serve neighborhoods that taxis wo n't visit . Just over half ( 53 % ) of ride-hailing users living in majority-minority communities feel that this statement describes ride-hailing well , compared with 46 % of users living in majority-white neighborhoods . ( Many ride-hailers – about four-in-ten overall – were unsure if this statement described ride-hailing well ) .
The number of legal permanent residents applying for U.S. citizenship in the nine months starting last October is at its highest level in four years , and it is up 8 % from the same period before the 2012 elections . Although some organizers of naturalization and voter registration drives have suggested the increase is a reaction to Donald Trump 's candidacy , a Pew Research Center analysis of naturalization data shows there have been much larger percentage increases in past years , with jumps not always coming during election years . So far this fiscal year – from October 2015 to June 2016 – 718,430 immigrants have applied for naturalization , a 26 % increase over the same time period a year before , according to data released by U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services . By comparison , the number of naturalization applications increased by 19 % in fiscal 2012 over the previous year .
The survey also asked Americans who say they do not use voice assistants about their reasons for not using them . Some 61 % of these non-users say they are just not interested in the tool . Around one-quarter of this group say they do not use voice assistants because none of the devices they own have this feature ( 28 % ) or because they are concerned about privacy ( 27 % ) . And a slightly smaller share ( 18 % ) reports that voice assistants are too complicated to use .
But it is also important to bear in mind that the percentage of Jewish adults who are the offspring of intermarriages appears to be rising . Just 6 % of Jews from the Silent Generation say they had one Jewish parent , compared with 18 % of Jewish Baby Boomers , 24 % of Generation X and nearly half ( 48 % ) of Jewish Millennials . The result is that there are far more Jews of no religion among younger generations of Jews than among previous generations , as shown in the survey report .
A majority of parents also report that their phone can get in the way of spending quality time with their children . Roughly seven-in-ten parents ( 68 % ) say they are at least sometimes distracted by their smartphone , with 17 % saying this happens often .
Young adults who have cellphones are also more likely than seniors to have used their cellphone during their most recent social gathering . Fully 98 % of young adults used their cellphone for one reason or another during their most recent get-together with others , compared with 69 % of cell owners 65 and older .
A majority of officers said in 2016 that relations between the police in their department and black people in the community they serve were `` excellent '' ( 8 % ) or `` good '' ( 47 % ) . However , far higher shares saw excellent or good community relations with whites ( 91 % ) , Asians ( 88 % ) and Hispanics ( 70 % ) . About a quarter of police officers ( 26 % ) said relations between police and black people in their community were `` only fair , '' while nearly one-in-five ( 18 % ) said they were `` poor '' – with black officers far more likely than others to say so . ( These percentages are based on only those officers who offered a rating . )
A multivariate analysis was used to better understand which factors matter most in predicting participation in the census . By far , age was the most important predictor of intention to participate , all other things being equal . But party affiliation , education and income also were significant predictors in the analysis . Race , ethnicity and gender were not significantly related to intended participation in the census , after controlling for other demographic characteristics . Younger Americans are less likely than older people to say they definitely will participate , even when controlling for other demographic characteristics . For those younger than 30 , the probability of saying they will definitely fill out the census form is .40 , compared with a probability of .75 for those 50 and older when all other variables are held constant at their mean . There also is a partisan divide in intention to participate ; all other things being equal , the probability of Democrats saying they definitely will participate is .75 while the probability for Republicans is .56 .
Americans with higher levels of educational attainment are more likely to say the U.S. has a responsibility to provide medical aid to undocumented immigrants who are ill with the coronavirus . About three-quarters of adults with a postgraduate degree ( 79 % ) or a bachelor 's degree ( 73 % ) say this , compared with about two-thirds among those with some college experience and those with a high school diploma or less ( each 64 % ) .
Most people around the globe say China plays a more important role in the world today than it did a decade ago – but most also say it 's better for the U.S. to lead the way . A median of 70 % across 25 countries say China is playing a more important role today compared with 10 years ago , while 31 % think the same about the U.S. At the same time , a median of 63 % believe it would be better to have the U.S. as the world 's leading power , but just 19 % say this about China . When it comes to which of the two nations is currently the world 's leading economic power , a median of 39 % point to the U.S. , while 34 % name China .
A small number of highly active bots were responsible for a large share of links to prominent news and media sites . We found that the 500 most active suspected bot accounts were responsible for 22 % of the tweeted links to popular news and current events sites during the study period . By comparison , the 500 most active human users were responsible for a much smaller share ( an estimated 6 % ) of tweeted links to these outlets . Note : These findings are based on an analysis of a sample of 1.2 million public tweets collected via Twitter 's streaming API between July 27 and Sept. 6 , 2017 , containing links to popular websites . See the report 's Methodology section for more details .
The economy is at the forefront of Hispanic voters ' minds in this presidential election year , with 86 % saying the economy is very important to their vote , according to a recent Pew Research Center survey . But while Hispanics are on the same page with the overall population about the importance of the economy , they are more positive about its condition and their family 's finances than some other racial and ethnic groups .
The public sees tougher financial times on the horizon for older Americans . A majority of U.S. adults ( 57 % ) say those ages 65 and older will have a worse standard of living in 2050 than they do today . About seven-in-ten ( 72 % ) say older adults will be less prepared financially for retirement than their counterparts today . And an even larger share ( 83 % ) believes most people will definitely or probably have to work into their 70s to be able to afford retirement .
Americans ' and Germans ' views of the relationship between their two countries remain sharply divergent . Americans continue to be rosy in their views of their country 's relationship with Germany , with nearly three-quarters saying that relations are good . Nearly two-in-ten Americans say that the relationship is very good ( 19 % ) , the largest share in four years of polling and up 6 percentage points from 2019 . Among Germans , 79 % say that the relationship with the U.S. is bad , a 15 percentage point increase in those saying this since 2019 and the highest negative sentiment in four years of surveys . The share of Germans who say that relations with the U.S. are good is at a mere 18 % , the lowest point measured over the same time .
Although many observers have documented a global decline in democratic rights in recent years , people around the world nonetheless embrace fundamental democratic values , including free expression . A new Pew Research Center survey finds that majorities in nearly all 38 nations polled say it is at least somewhat important to live in a country with free speech , a free press and freedom on the internet . And across the 38 countries , global medians of 50 % or more consider these freedoms very important .
More than eight-in-ten registered voters ( 84 % ) say they are at least somewhat confident that people who are legally qualified and want to vote will be able to cast a ballot , while nearly as many ( 79 % ) express confidence that in-person polling places will be run safely and without spreading the coronavirus . About two-thirds ( 66 % ) say they are at least somewhat confident that after all votes are counted , it will be clear who won the election , while 62 % are at least somewhat confident that people who are not legally qualified to vote will be prevented from casting ballots . While most voters express at least some confidence in these four aspects of the presidential election , relatively small shares are very confident of each . For example , only about four-in-ten say they are very confident that people who are legally qualified and want to vote will be able to cast a ballot in the election , while only 22 % say they are very confident that once the votes are counted it will be clear who won the election . Voters are less confident that the nation will know the outcome of the election within a few days of Nov. 3 or that mail-in ballots will be delivered in time to be counted , with about half saying they are at least somewhat confident these will happen ( 50 % and 52 % , respectively ) . Just 13 % of voters say they are very confident mail ballots will be delivered on time , while a similarly slim share ( 15 % ) say they are very confident the winner will be known within a day or two of Election Day . Though majorities of Trump and Biden voters say they are at least somewhat confident that people who are legally qualified and want to vote are able to cast a ballot , Trump voters are more likely than Biden voters to say this ( 93 % vs. 77 % , respectively ) . And while only about a third of Biden supporters ( 32 % ) are very confident that people who want to vote will be able to , half of Trump voters have a high level of confidence this will occur .
Concurrently , the center of political gravity in the European Parliament has shifted to the right . Historically , the three main groupings representing the center-left , center-right and centrist liberals held three-quarters or more of seats , but in the 2009 election their collective share slipped to 73 % , and in 2014 it fell further to 64 % . Parties classified as right-wing to far right now hold a fifth of European Parliament seats , more than double their share two decades ago . And after years of post-Cold War decline , parties categorized as left-wing to far left won 7 % of seats in 2014 , their biggest win in 15 years .
Six-in-ten non-broadband users say they have never had high-speed internet service at home in the past , while one-third indicate that they had previously subscribed to these services . And when asked if they are interested in having home broadband in the future , most non-adopters are unenthusiastic about the prospect . Fully 80 % of non-broadband users say they would not be interested in having broadband at home , while 18 % think this is something they would consider in the future . These sentiments are on par with those found in the Center 's 2015 survey .
However , nearly eight-in-ten in Denmark ( 78 % ) express skepticism that more international cooperation would have led to fewer coronavirus cases in their country . Clear majorities in Australia ( 59 % ) and Germany ( 56 % ) say the same . In these same countries , roughly nine-in-ten or more say their own government handled the coronavirus outbreak well .
Most partisans say their side in politics is `` losing . '' A large majority of the public ( 67 % ) says `` their side '' in politics has been losing more often than winning in recent years on issues that matter to them . As in the past , this sentiment is less pronounced among those who support the party in control of the White House than the party out of power . Even so , more Republicans and Republican-leaning independents feel like their side has been losing more often than winning ( 53 % to 44 % ) .
A median of 53 % say that migrants make their country stronger through their hard work and talents , while 41 % believe they take jobs and social benefits . Swedes and Brits are the most positive : Roughly six-in-ten think immigrant talent benefits their country , and half or more in Germany , Spain , France and the Netherlands say the same . But just 5 % in Hungary express this view . Opinions on this issue have shifted with time in some countries . Since 2014 , more people in France ( increase of 11 percentage points ) , the UK ( +10 ) and Spain ( +9 ) share the view that immigrants strengthen their country .
Of the four potential developments we measured , public attitudes towards ubiquitous wearable or implanted computing devices are the most positive , or more accurately , the least negative . Although 53 % of Americans think it would be a bad thing if `` most people wear implants or other devices that constantly show them information about the world around them , '' just over one third ( 37 % ) think this would be a change for the better .
Those in every country surveyed worry about the impact of mobile phones on children . Across these 11 emerging economies , a median of 79 % of adults say people should be very concerned about children being exposed to harmful or immoral content when using their phones . In most countries , half or more say mobile phones and the internet have had a bad impact on children – more than the percentage who say they are concerned about the influence of technology on other facets of society included in the survey , such as politics , local culture and morality . Parents are taking steps to monitor and regulate what their child does online or on their mobile phone . A median of 52 % of parents whose children have a mobile phone say they at times limit how much time their child spends on their phone , and a median of 50 % say they ever monitor what their child is looking at or doing on their mobile phone .
Most U.S. adults ( 63 % ) say a major reason for higher COVID-19 hospitalization rates among Black people is that they are more likely to live in densely populated areas . Smaller but still substantial shares point to Black people being more likely to have other health conditions that put them at risk ( 52 % ) , that they are less likely to have access to adequate health care ( 49 % ) and that they are more likely to work in industries that require contact with the public ( 45 % ) . Black Americans are particularly likely to see some of these explanations as major reasons why Black people have been hospitalized at higher rates than other racial or ethnic groups . For example , about two-thirds of Black adults ( 66 % ) say a major reason is that Black people are more likely to have other health conditions that put them at risk , compared with about half or fewer Asian ( 52 % ) , white ( 51 % ) and Hispanic adults ( 45 % ) . And while a majority of Black ( 71 % ) and Asian ( 61 % ) Americans say a major reason for the higher hospitalization rates is that Black people have less access to adequate health care , the share falls to 45 % among both white and Hispanic Americans .
For example , close to nine-in-ten liberal Democrats ( 86 % ) believe these platforms are very or somewhat important for creating sustained social movements , compared with around seven-in-ten conservative or moderate Democrats ( 73 % ) and just over half of liberal or moderate Republicans ( 56 % ) and conservative Republicans ( 53 % ) . Partisans ' views are more closely aligned when they are asked about the importance of these platforms for getting elected officials to pay attention to issues or influencing policy decisions .
Afro-Latinos are one of these Latino identity groups . They are characterized by their diverse views of racial identity , reflecting the complex and varied nature of race and identity among Latinos . A Pew Research Center survey of Latino adults shows that one-quarter of all U.S. Latinos self-identify as Afro-Latino , Afro-Caribbean or of African descent with roots in Latin America . This is the first time a nationally representative survey in the U.S. has asked the Latino population directly whether they considered themselves Afro-Latino .
The survey asked respondents how important following the news was for being a good citizen , and those who say following the news is `` very important '' are more likely to correctly answer whether three or more of the six sources conduct their own news reporting . Over half of those who say following the news is very important ( 55 % ) correctly answered three or more of the original reporting questions , compared with 44 % of those who say following news is somewhat important and 32 % of those who say it is not too or not at all important .
In addition to the Cain allegations , most Americans say they heard at least a little last week about large banks abandoning plans to charge monthly fees for using debit cards to shop ( 46 % a lot , 33 % a little ) . Far fewer had heard about the arrest of four older men in Georgia on charges that they were planning a terror attack involving the poison ricin . Just 8 % had heard a lot about this story , 30 % had heard a little . About six-in-ten ( 61 % ) had heard nothing at all about this .
Across a range of measures , Indian public opinion is consistently pro-American . The 2005 Pew Global Attitudes survey found that about seven-in-ten Indians ( 71 % ) have a favorable view of the United States . Of the 17 countries polled in the survey , only Americans themselves hold a more favorable view of their country . And while U.S. favorability ratings have plunged in many countries , Indians are significantly more positive about the United States now than they were in the summer of 2002 , when 54 % gave the U.S. favorable marks .
Among Hispanics , more immigrants ( 94 % ) than the U.S. born ( 82 % ) support allowing undocumented immigrants to stay in the U.S. legally . Majorities of black ( 81 % ) , Asian ( 76 % ) and white adults ( 70 % ) also express support .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's visit to the U.S. drew a large news audience last week . Aside from the Iraq war it was the most closely followed news story , with 23 % of the public following the story very closely , and 14 % listing it as the single news story they followed most closely . Ahmadinejad 's visit , as well as broader issues relating to U.S.-Iranian relations , was the most heavily covered news story of the week . Fully 13 % of the national newshole was devoted to this story .
The public 's wariness toward global engagement extends to U.S. participation in the global economy . Nearly half of Americans ( 49 % ) say U.S. involvement in the global economy is a bad thing because it lowers wages and costs jobs ; fewer ( 44 % ) see this as a good thing because it provides the U.S. with new markets and opportunities for growth . Trump 's primary campaign supporters stand out for their negative assessments of U.S. involvement in the global economy . Fully 65 % of Republican registered voters who prefer Trump for the Republican presidential nomination say U.S. involvement in the global economy is a bad thing , compared with only about half of those who prefer Cruz ( 49 % ) or Kasich ( 46 % ) .
About two-thirds ( 64 % ) of H-1B visa requests in fiscal 2011 were for occupations in the fields of science , technology , engineering and math ( STEM ) , according to the most recently available government data . Nine-in-ten H-1B visa requests ( 90 % ) are for jobs that require some high-level STEM knowledge . Most H-1B applications ( 75 % ) require high-level computer knowledge , and roughly half require significant engineering and math skills . High-level scientific knowledge is less commonly requested .
Wide partisan divides exist over whether the U.S. should send ground troops . Two-thirds of Republicans ( 66 % ) – including 72 % of conservative Republicans – say they would favor sending U.S. ground troops to Iraq and Syria , while just 28 % are opposed . Among Democrats , views are the reverse : 64 % oppose sending ground troops to Iraq and Syria , 33 % are in favor . Among independents , about as many favor ( 48 % ) as oppose ( 47 % ) the use of U.S. ground forces to fight Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria . Views among partisan groups are little different than they were in July 2015 .
The move occurs amid a larger , but slow-moving , national trend . While the degree of racial segregation within religious congregations remains high , some houses of worship in the U.S. have become more diverse in recent years , according to findings from the most recent ( 2012 ) National Congregations Study ( NCS ) , directed by Duke University researcher Mark Chaves . ( The most recent study received financial support from the Pew Research Center 's Religion & Public Life Project . )
The destinations of emigrants from Latin American and Caribbean countries have changed somewhat since 1990 , though the United States remains the overwhelming destination of choice . The U.S. was home to 67 % of the region 's emigrants in 2017 , almost unchanged from 62 % in 1990 . In 2017 , 16 % of emigrants lived in other Latin American-Caribbean countries , down from 26 % in 1990 . Argentina was the top destination country for this group of emigrants , with 1.8 million people from other Latin American countries living there in 2017 , up from 830,000 in 1990 . Meanwhile , the share of Latin American and Caribbean emigrants living in Europe reached 12 % in 2017 , up from 7 % in 1990 .
On Iran , by contrast , there are major differences . While majorities in both parties have cold feelings , these views are much more widespread – and more intensely negative – among Republicans . A 64 % majority of Republicans have very cold feelings toward Iran , compared with only 34 % of Democrats .
Finer differences emerge in which sites share news users . Looking at sites that share at least 25 % of their news users with another site , audience overlap most commonly exists among news users of smaller sites who also visit Facebook and/or YouTube for news , the two sites with the most news users overall . About half or more news users of each of the other sites studied also get news on Facebook , while about a quarter or more overlap on YouTube . Four of the sites have considerable overlap with Twitter : Roughly a third or more of news users of Instagram , Snapchat , LinkedIn and Reddit also get news on Twitter . Beyond Facebook , YouTube and Twitter , there is less widespread overlap in news use with the other sites . However , news users of Instagram and Snapchat have considerable overlap with each other , and at least a third of WhatsApp news users also get news from both of these sites , even though a relatively small share of the population uses these sites for news . Only a small portion ( less than 25 % ) of any of these sites ' news users also gets news from Reddit , LinkedIn , WhatsApp or Tumblr .
Americans – regardless of whether they are in a relationship – were asked in the survey about their views about some issues related to technology and relationships . For example , they weighed in on the acceptability of looking through a significant other 's phone without that person 's knowledge . Seven-in-ten U.S. adults say it is rarely ( 28 % ) or never ( 42 % ) acceptable to look through a significant other 's cellphone without their knowledge . Smaller shares – about three-in-ten ( 29 % ) – view this behavior as at least sometimes acceptable .
Youth is a defining characteristic of the U.S. Latino population . About six-in-ten Latinos ( 61 % ) in the U.S. were 35 or younger in 2016 . The number of young Latinos –35 million – increased 20 % from a decade earlier , making it one of the largest and fastest-growing youth populations in the country . With a median age of 28 , Latinos are also the nation 's youngest major racial or ethnic group . Here are some key facts about them :
Anxiety about the growing strength of China 's military is nearly universal in Japan . That concern is shared with others among China 's neighbors – large majorities in both Russia and India see this as a threatening trend . The Chinese , however , have a very different view : 95 % say their rising military might is a good thing .
A majority of U.S. adults trust medical scientists a lot for information about vaccines . Some 55 % of Americans said in 2016 that they trust medical scientists a lot to give full and accurate information about the health risks and benefits of the childhood MMR vaccine . Another 35 % said they have some trust in medical scientists , while just 9 % said they trust them not too much or not at all . High degrees of trust in other groups were much lower , however . For example , no more than one-in-ten Americans placed a lot of trust in elected officials ( 6 % ) and news media ( 8 % ) to provide accurate information about the MMR vaccine .
The risk of divorce for adults ages 50 and older is also higher among those who have been married for a shorter time . For example , among adults 50 and older who had been married for less than 10 years , the divorce rate was 21 people per 1,000 married persons in 2015 . By contrast , the divorce rate is 13 people per 1,000 married persons for adults ages 50 and older who had been married for 20 to 29 years . This is largely connected to remarriages being less stable than first marriages . In fact , most adults in this group who have been married less than 20 years were in their second or higher marriage .
The average audience for the four newsmagazine shows aired by the networks – ABC 's 20/20 , CBS 's 60 Minutes and 48 Hours , and NBC 's Dateline – declined in 2018 , down 8 % from 2017 .
Across these countries , a median of 66 % say being a member of the official or favored faith is very or somewhat important to national identity ( e.g . `` being truly Armenian '' ) . In most countries without an official or preferred religion , substantially smaller shares ( median of 43 % ) say this about the dominant religious group in their country . In Greece , for instance , where Greek Orthodoxy is the country 's official religion , 76 % of adults say being Orthodox is important to being Greek . In Poland , where the Roman Catholic Church is preferred by the government , 64 % say being Catholic is important to being truly Polish .
Such analyses , though , rely on projections of how many same-sex couples will want to marry . In the Pew Research Center 's recent survey of LGBT Americans , similar percentages of unmarried gay men and lesbians ( 56 % and 58 % , respectively ) said they would like to get married someday ; 4 % of gay men and 6 % of lesbians said they were currently legally married ( the report did not attempt to estimate the total LGBT population ) .
Americans with lower incomes are especially likely to express concern about broadband and cellphone bills . Roughly half of lower-income broadband users ( 52 % ) say they worry a lot or some about being able to pay for their high-speed internet connection over the coming months , compared with 26 % of those with incomes in the middle and just 9 % of those in the high-income tier . Among smartphone owners , 54 % of those who have lower incomes say they worry at least some about paying their cellphone bills , compared with 25 % of those who are middle income and just 9 % of upper-income users .
In general , the public expresses the most interest in news from Iraq and Afghanistan , where thousands of U.S. forces have been stationed for years . Nearly eight-in-ten say they are very or somewhat interested in what happens in Iraq ( 78 % ) and Afghanistan ( 77 % ) .
Overall , about six-in-ten Americans say they are bothered `` a lot '' by the feeling that some corporations ( 62 % ) and wealthy people ( 60 % ) do not pay their fair share in taxes . Fewer American express strong concerns about the complexity of the tax system ( 39 % say they are bothered a lot by this ) , the amount they pay in taxes ( 27 % ) and whether poor people pay their fair share in taxes ( 16 % ) .
News about the economy continues to top the public 's news agenda . In the current survey , 38 % say they are following reports about the condition of the U.S. economy very closely , compared with 27 % who say they are following election news very closely .
When asked which country is the world 's leading economic power , Americans and Germans give starkly different answers . Half of Americans name the U.S. , with about a third ( 32 % ) choosing China . However , roughly half of Germans name China ( 53 % ) as the leading economic power compared with 24 % who name the U.S . Relatively few in both countries see Japan or the countries of the European Union as the leading economic power , although 14 % in Germany name the EU , about twice as many as in the U.S .
Texting is by far the most frequent way teens interact with their romantic partner . Nearly three-quarters ( 72 % ) of teen daters say they spend time texting with their partner daily . Among teens who have had relationships , talking on the phone ( 39 % ) ranks second for everyday interactions , followed by instant messaging ( 29 % ) , being together in person ( 21 % ) , social media ( 21 % ) and messaging apps ( 20 % ) . Fewer teen daters interact daily with their romantic partner by video chatting , emailing or playing video games .
Facebook claims the largest share of social media news consumers , and its news users are much more likely to rely solely on that site for news . Just under half ( 45 % ) of U.S. adults use Facebook for news . Half of Facebook 's news users get news from that social media site alone , with just one-in-five relying on three or more sites for news .
About four-in-ten ( 43 % ) expect that the Republicans in Congress will be fair and reasonable in handling the inquiry ; 57 % say they are not too confident or not at all confident . Nearly half ( 47 % ) are at least somewhat confident that congressional Democrats will be fair , while 52 % have little or no confidence in the Democrats . These views are deeply divided by party . About seven-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners ( 71 % ) say they are at least somewhat confident in congressional Republicans to be fair , but only 22 % say they are very confident . By contrast , 90 % of Republicans express little or no confidence in Democrats in Congress – with 67 % saying they are not at all confident .
Even as publics in many of the surveyed countries express a clear preference for women to dress conservatively , many also say women should be able to decide for themselves what to wear . This attitude is most prevalent in Tunisia ( 56 % ) , Turkey ( 52 % ) and Lebanon ( 49 % ) – all countries where substantial percentages are open to women not covering their heads in public . But nearly as many in Saudi Arabia ( 47 % ) also say a women should be free to choose how she dresses . Smaller , but sizable percentages agree in Iraq ( 27 % ) , Pakistan ( 22 % ) and Egypt ( 14 % ) . What the survey leaves unanswered is whether respondents think social or cultural norms will guide women in their choice to wear more conservative or less conservative attire in public .
One big reason for the good performance of our visitors is that most of them are well educated , and college-educated people tend to do very well on the quiz . Nearly three-quarters of our website quiz takers ( 74 % ) are college graduates , while another 20 % have completed at least some college . Among the 1,041 adults in the general public sample , only 29 % had completed college and 29 % had some college experience .
Roughly half of Americans ( 48 % ) say it is acceptable for DNA testing companies to share customers ' genetic data with law enforcement agencies to help solve crimes , according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults conducted June 3 - 17 , 2019 . Fewer – a third – say this is unacceptable , while 18 % are unsure . Similar shares of Americans across most demographic groups say that law enforcement 's use of genetic data for crimes is acceptable , and that applies when asking specifically about Americans ' use of mail-in DNA tests . About half ( 51 % ) of adults who have used DNA mail-in services say this use of genetic data is acceptable , compared with 48 % of adults who have not used these mail-in services . However , there are a few exceptions where there are differences among groups . For example , 56 % of adults ages 50 and older say it is acceptable for DNA testing companies to share genetic data with law enforcement to help solve crimes , compared with 42 % of those under 50 years old . There is a smaller , yet statistically significant , difference by party – Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents to approve of the data use ( 52 % vs. 47 % ) .
Nationally , 52 % of voters backed Republican candidates for Congress , while 47 % voted for Democrats , according to exit polls by the National Election Pool , as reported by The New York Times . The overall vote share is similar to the GOP 's margin in the 2010 elections , and many of the key demographic divides seen in that election — particularly wide gender and age gaps — remain .
More broadly , many of Pakistan 's Muslims think that religious leaders should have a role in politics . About half say that religious leaders should have either `` some influence '' ( 27 % ) or a `` large influence '' ( 27 % ) in political matters , while about a quarter say religious leaders should have `` not too much influence '' ( 12 % ) or `` no influence at all '' ( 14 % ) .
A majority ( 56 % ) of moderate non-Tea Party Republicans say the party 's position on gay marriage is too conservative . That compares with just 22 % of Tea Party Republicans and 21 % of GOP conservatives who do not agree with the Tea Party . Among the latter groups , more say the party 's stance on gay marriage is not conservative enough ( 35 % of Tea Party , 34 % of non-Tea conservatives ) than say it is too conservative .
Majorities or pluralities in 22 of the 34 countries surveyed say men generally have more opportunities for high-paying jobs than women , including about two-thirds or more in Sweden , France , Japan , South Korea , Israel , Spain , the UK , Australia and Canada . More than four-in-ten in Greece , Nigeria , Russia , Lebanon and Argentina also think men in their country have more opportunities when it comes to getting high-paying jobs , but similar shares think opportunities are generally the same for men and women .
Trust is an essential elixir for public life and neighborly relations , and when Americans think about trust these days , they worry . Two-thirds of adults think other Americans have little or no confidence in the federal government . Majorities believe the public 's confidence in the U.S. government and in each other is shrinking , and most believe a shortage of trust in government and in other citizens makes it harder to solve some of the nation 's key problems . As a result , many think it is necessary to clean up the trust environment : 68 % say it is very important to repair the public 's level of confidence in the federal government , and 58 % say the same about improving confidence in fellow Americans .
When it comes to evaluating their own online habits , teens express mixed views about whether or not they themselves spend too much time on various screens . Roughly half ( 54 % ) believe they spend too much time on their cellphone , while 41 % say they spend too much time on social media . By contrast , only around one-quarter ( 26 % ) believe they spend too much time playing video games – comparable to the share ( 22 % ) who say they spend too little time gaming . Meanwhile , roughly four-in-ten teens say they spend about the right amount of time on social media or gaming . Despite these varying views about screen time , roughly half or more teens say they have tried to limit the amount of time they spend on each technology . Some 52 % have ever cut back on the time they spend on their cellphone , while 57 % have limited their time spent on social media and 58 % have cut back on their time playing video games .
Yet a Pew Research Center survey , conducted Jan. 23-Feb. 9 , shows that most Americans favor a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants , though there are partisan and ideological differences over the issue . Nationwide , 76 % say people currently in the country illegally should be eligible for citizenship if they meet certain requirements , and just 23 % disagree . Among Republicans , that majority slips to 66 % vs. 32 % . And narrowing further to Republicans who agree with the Tea Party still finds a 59 % majority in favor of a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants , and 39 % opposed .
This new approach gave us tremendous flexibility . Not only did we find out how people report race , we could see how many Americans marked only one race for themselves but had a mixed-race background when their parents ' or grandparents ' racial makeup was considered . We also could see in which generation a different race or races appeared in the family tree , and how multiracial identity persists or fades over the generations . We had discovered in some of our early survey tests that most mixed-race adults did not consider themselves to be multiracial . We wanted to understand this response , so in the final survey we asked this group why they did not consider themselves to be multiracial .
Independents feel more negatively about political candidates and parties than partisans . In early 2018 , similar shares of Republicans ( 77 % ) and Democrats ( 74 % ) said the quality of candidates running for Congress in their district in the last several elections had been good . But those who leaned toward the parties were much less likely to say this .
When it comes to policies aimed at reducing the effects of global climate change , about half of U.S. adults ( 49 % ) believe these policies have net benefits for the environment . Three-in-ten say these policies make no difference for the environment and about two-in-ten ( 19 % ) believe these policies end up doing more harm than good for the environment . As with other climate issues , there are sizable political divides over the effects of climate policies . About eight-in-ten liberal Democrats ( 78 % ) say climate change policies do more good than harm , compared with 56 % of moderate or conservative Democrats . Republicans are more inclined to believe such policies have little impact or bring net harm to the environment . Among conservative Republicans , about half ( 48 % ) say these policies make no difference and three-in-ten ( 31 % ) say these policies do more harm than good for the environment .
Partisans also differ in the role they see police performing . For example , about a third of Democrats ( 31 % ) and independents ( 33 % ) say they see police in this country more as enforcers than protectors , roughly double the share of Republicans who say this ( 17 % ) . Republicans , for their part , are more likely to say police in this country fill both of these roles equally ( 67 % ) compared with Democrats ( 52 % ) and independents ( 53 % ) .
About one-in-ten ( 11 % ) say they followed news about a deadly spill of toxic sludge in Hungary very closely ; 3 % say they followed this news most closely . The spill accounted for 2 % of the newshole examined by PEJ .
Currently , 41 % of Democrats say they have a favorable opinion of the federal government , compared with 27 % of independents and just 13 % of Republicans . By contrast , state and local governments are viewed favorably across-the-board . Nearly identical percentages of Democrats ( 56 % ) , Republicans ( 57 % ) and independents ( 59 % ) have a favorable opinion of their state 's government . Similarly , local governments receive positive ratings from 67 % of Democrats , 63 % of Republicans and 60 % of independents .
Almost six-in-ten Americans ( 57 % ) consider it an appropriate use of technology to genetically engineer animals to grow organs or tissues that could be used for humans needing a transplant , while 41 % say this would be going too far , according to a new survey by Pew Research Center .
The new survey finds that parents with children ages 4 or younger are more concerned than other Americans about the potential risk of side effects from the MMR vaccine . About half ( 52 % ) of parents with children ages 0 to 4 say the risk of side effects is low , while 43 % say it is medium or high . By contrast , seven-in-ten adults with no minor-age children ( 70 % ) rate the risk of side effects from the vaccine as low .
4 Many Americans say NATO does too little to solve global problems . In an October 2017 Pew Research Center survey , almost half of Americans ( 48 % ) said NATO does not do enough to help solve world problems . About a third ( 31 % ) said NATO does the right amount , while just 5 % said the alliance does too much to solve the world 's problems .
Majorities in all 14 countries surveyed agree that global climate change and the spread of infectious diseases pose major threats to their country . Concern about climate change is especially high in Spain , France , Italy , South Korea and Japan , with at least eight-in-ten in each country describing it as a major threat .
Prior to the election , Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton supporters had starkly different views about how life in America has changed over the past 50 years . About eight-in-ten Trump backers ( 81 % ) said life is worse than it was 50 years ago for people like them , compared with just 11 % who said it has gotten better . Most Clinton supporters took the opposite stance : About six-in-ten ( 59 % ) said life for people like them has gotten better over the past half-century , while 19 % said it has gotten worse .
Conservative Republicans are particularly skeptical that policies can make a difference in addressing climate change . Just one-quarter of conservative Republicans say climate change policies do more good than harm for the environment , while about half ( 47 % ) say such policies make no difference for the environment and 26 % think such policies do more harm than good . By contrast , a large majority of liberal Democrats ( 81 % ) say climate change policies have net benefits for the environment .
In the high-stakes battle over replacing Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court , a majority of Americans ( 56 % ) say the Senate should hold hearings and vote on President Obama 's choice to fill the vacancy . About four-in-ten ( 38 % ) say the Senate should not hold hearings until the next president selects a court nominee .
The Obama administration has had its share of ups and downs during the last five years when it comes to how the public sees it , but there 's been at least one constant on the positive side — the large number of Americans who have a favorable view of First Lady Michelle Obama . Because Michelle Obama 's unfavorable rating among conservative Republicans stood out , we looked back at other first ladies to see how they fared among the public , as well as those at the far end of the opposition party . To be sure , comparing first ladies and how the public views them is a tricky exercise because there is no `` job description '' for the position and each one has shaped her role in different ways and in different political environments .
A 2015 Pew Research Center survey found that nearly six-in-ten Americans ( 57 % ) believe it is unacceptable for the government to monitor the communications of American citizens . But the survey found that around half of Americans say it is acceptable for the U.S. government to monitor the communications of citizens of other countries .
When asked about the financial situation of average people in their country , roughly equal pluralities of Germans and Americans say it is worse than it was 20 years ago ( 46 % and 45 % , respectively ) . And only about a third in each country believe the financial situation of ordinary people is better .
A new analysis of Pew Research Center survey data from fall 2016 finds that 53 % of Millennials ( those ages 18 to 35 at the time ) say they used a library or bookmobile in the previous 12 months . That compares with 45 % of Gen Xers , 43 % of Baby Boomers and 36 % of those in the Silent Generation . ( It is worth noting that the question wording specifically focused on use of public libraries , not on-campus academic libraries . )
While the public expects greater discord between two parties they view as far apart , rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats see their own parties as united . Overall , 55 % of Republicans and Republican leaners describe the GOP as mostly united on issues and its vision for the future .
Comparable proportions of Democrats who are college graduates ( 88 % ) and those with less education ( 82 % ) say that there is solid evidence that the earth is getting warmer . Among Democrats , higher education is associated with the belief that global warming is mostly caused by human activity . Fully 75 % of Democrats with college degrees say that the earth is warming and that this is caused by human activity . Just 52 % of Democrats with less education express this view . Among Republicans , similar percentages of college graduates and those with less education say there is solid evidence of global warming ( 46 % and 51 % , respectively ) . Yet for Republicans , unlike Democrats , higher education is associated with greater skepticism that human activity is causing global warming . Only 19 % of Republican college graduates say that there is solid evidence that the earth is warming and it is caused by human activity , while 31 % of Republicans with less education say the same .
Western Europeans with populist views are less likely than non-populists to say the news media are very important to the functioning of their country 's society . This pattern appeared in seven of eight Western European countries surveyed by Pew Research Center in 2017 ( the exception was Spain ) . The differences in views between populists and non-populists were even more pronounced than the differences between those who place themselves on the ideological left and right . In the Netherlands , for example , populists were 20 points less likely than non-populists to say the news media are very important to the functioning of society ( 35 % vs. 55 % ) . The left-right difference on this question was only 8 points . Most people say news organizations in their country are doing well at reporting on the most important news events , according to a 2017 survey of 38 countries . Ratings of the news media were measured , however : Across the nations surveyed , a median of just 26 % said the news media were doing very well at reporting on the most important news events . Ratings of the media were highest in sub-Saharan Africa and the Asia-Pacific region , where medians of 82 % and 74 % , respectively , said that the media were doing well at covering the most important news stories . Majorities in Greece and South Korea said the media were not doing well at covering the most important stories .
In Russia proper , the public also sees the matter as closed . More than eight-in-ten Russians ( 84 % ) think the March 16th referendum was fair and even more ( 89 % ) say Kyiv ought to validate the results , according to a new Pew Research survey in Russia , conducted among 1,000 randomly selected adults between April 4 - 20 . The same survey finds that majorities of Russians ( 61 % ) agree that there are parts of neighboring countries that belong to Russia , and that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a great tragedy ( 55 % ) . While the poll did not explicitly ask Russians whether they supported the Kremlin taking military action to protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine , nearly two-thirds ( 65 % ) agree that military action is sometimes necessary to maintain order in the world .
In that same survey , Greeks expressed relatively high levels of anti-American sentiment . Just 39 % in Greece expressed positive views of the U.S. , among the lowest measured in the spring 39-nation survey . Only publics in Turkey , the Palestinian territories , Egypt , Jordan , and Pakistan thought worse of America . This negative impression of the U.S. coincides with less than stellar views of President Obama . Only about a third of Greeks ( 35 % ) have confidence in the American president to handle international affairs , with 62 % expressing little or no confidence .
Men and women have similar value priorities for children for all but a handful of qualities . To the extent that there are differences , women are more inclined to prioritize helping others and empathy as important . A clear majority of women and men say that teaching children about helping others is important ( 89 % and 80 % , respectively for women and men ) but women are relatively more inclined to say this . And 26 % of women , compared with 18 % of men , say it is one of the most important values to teach children .
Indeed , the more devices someone owns , the more likely they are to use Twitter or another service to update their status . Fully 39 % of internet users with four or more internet-connected devices ( such as a laptop , cell phone , game console , or Kindle ) use Twitter , compared to 28 % of internet users with three devices , 19 % of internet users with two devices , and 10 % of internet users with one device .
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center , conducted May 12 - 18 among 2,002 adults ( including 1,497 registered voters ) , finds increasing interest in the presidential campaign . The share of registered voters who say they are giving at least some thought to the presidential candidates has risen eight points since March , from 58 % to 66 % . However , just 29 % of registered voters say they are giving `` a lot '' of thought to candidates who may be running for president in 2016 . Interest in the presidential candidates has increased among voters in both parties since March . Currently , 69 % of Republican and Republican-leaning voters say they are giving at least some thought to the candidates , up from 61 % in March . Among Democrats , 65 % are giving a lot or some thought to the candidates , compared with 57 % in March .
Around four-in-ten white evangelical Protestants ( 38 % ) say humans have always existed in their present form , and about a quarter ( 27 % ) of black Protestants share this view , according to the new study . Among white mainline Protestants , just 16 % say humans have always existed in their present form . Similar shares of Catholics ( 13 % ) and the religiously unaffiliated ( 11 % ) say the same . Only among the religiously unaffiliated – those who describe their religion as atheist , agnostic or `` nothing in particular '' – do a majority ( 64 % ) accept evolution via natural selection with no involvement from God or a higher power . Both Protestants and Catholics are considerably more likely to say evolution was guided or allowed by God than they are to say that humans evolved due to processes such as natural selection , or to say that humans have always existed in their present form .
Student debt is less common among older age groups . Roughly one-in-five adults ages 30 to 44 ( 22 % ) have student loan debt , as do 4 % of those 45 and older .
There is greater tolerance in the U.S. than in Europe for offensive speech . A solid majority ( 77 % ) of Americans believe citizens should be allowed to make statements that are offensive to people 's religious beliefs , a significantly higher share of the public than in any of the European Union nations included in our 2015 survey . In Poland , Germany and Italy , fewer than half think this kind of speech should be legal . Similarly , Americans are more likely to say offensive statements about minority groups should be permitted .
Mexico has recently experienced increased immigration from Central America , and the Mexican government apprehended nearly 92,000 migrants in the first seven months of fiscal 2019 . Against this backdrop , around half ( 48 % ) of Mexicans gave unfavorable ratings to Central Americans fleeing to Mexico . Younger people had more favorable views of Central American migrants in Mexico than those 50 and older . Regardless of gender , income or level of education , Mexicans tended to be slightly more negative than positive . Colombia has received more than 1 million Venezuelan immigrants in recent years since political and economic unrest began escalating under current Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro . Amid this influx , more than half of Colombian adults ( 54 % ) said they held an unfavorable view of migrants in Colombia ; 42 % had a favorable opinion . Younger Colombians were more likely than their older counterparts to have favorable views of people from other countries who live in Colombia .
Overall , just 36 % of the public approves of how Trump is handling negotiations over the government shutdown , including 23 % who say they strongly approve . About six-in-ten ( 61 % ) disapprove of Trump 's approach to the negotiations , including 53 % who say they strongly disapprove .
People 's views about scientists connected with GM foods : Americans with deep concern about the issue of GM foods hold mixed views about scientists connected with GM foods . Those deeply concerned about this issue say that scientists understand the health effects of GM foods very well ( 32 % ) . And , 35 % of this group says they trust scientists a lot to provide full and accurate information about the health effects of eating GM foods . But in these areas their views look similar to Americans with less concern about the issue of GM foods .
The August Pew poll found that 46 % of the public says that Mitt Romney is very religious . This is comparable to the percentage saying that George W. Bush is very religious , and is much greater than for any other presidential candidate in the race for either party 's nomination .
Overall , whites are less likely than blacks to say that blacks face at least some discrimination ( 77 % vs. 91 % ) . Among whites , there is a wide partisan gap in views of discrimination against blacks ( 91 % of white Democrats and Democratic leaners say there is at least some discrimination against blacks in our society , compared with 66 % of white Republicans ) . A similar pattern is seen for Hispanics . Whites overall are less likely to say that Hispanics face discrimination ( 73 % of whites say this , compared with 86 % of Hispanics ) . However , 90 % of white Democrats say that Hispanics face at least some discrimination compared with 59 % of white Republicans . When asked about discrimination against whites , whites are more likely than blacks or Hispanics to say that there is at least some discrimination against whites in the U.S. ( 44 % of whites say this compared to 29 % of blacks and 33 % of Hispanics ) . Yet while 60 % of white Republicans say society discriminates against whites , only 24 % of white Democrats share this view .
Three-in-ten ( 30 % ) say they followed news about Haiti most closely , while about two-in-ten say they followed news about the economy ( 21 % ) or the storms ( 20 % ) more closely than any other major story . One-in-ten say they followed news about the opening of the Winter Olympics in Vancouver , Canada , most closely , while smaller numbers say continuing safety concerns about Toyota vehicles ( 4 % ) and former President Clinton 's heart troubles ( 1 % ) were their top stories of the week .
The survey found that between 2006 and 2012 , the share of congregations allowing an openly gay or lesbian couple to become full-fledged members grew from 37 % to 48 % . In addition , the number of congregations that allowed openly gay and lesbian members to assume any lay leadership position also increased – from 18 % in 2006 to 26 % in 2012 .
The public has mixed reactions to the U.S. response to the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants arriving in Europe in recent weeks . By a narrow 51 % -45 % margin , more approve than disapprove of the U.S. decision to increase the number of refugees it accepts to help deal with this situation .
Prior to the Civil War , higher education opportunities were virtually nonexistent for nearly all black Americans . In the years following the war , more colleges sprang up to meet the educational needs of the newly freed black population . Congress defines a historically black college or university ( HBCU ) as a school `` established prior to 1964 , whose principal mission was , and is , the education of black Americans . ''
Large majorities say the tone and nature of political debate in the United States has become more negative in recent years – as well as less respectful , less fact-based and less substantive . Donald Trump is a major factor in people 's views about the state of the nation 's political discourse . A 55 % majority says Trump has changed the tone and nature of political debate in this country for the worse ; fewer than half as many ( 24 % ) say he has changed it for the better , while 20 % say he has had little impact .
The second most closely followed news story , far behind the shootings , was the situation in Iraq — 27 % of the public followed events in Iraq very closely and 15 % said this was the news story they followed more closely than any other last week . Over the past month , the public has consistently expressed greater interest in the war itself than in the policy debate
And although 61 % of Germans have a favorable view of the UN , they share some skepticism about the organization 's care for ordinary citizens and its handling of climate change . A majority of Germans say the UN does not care about the needs of ordinary people , and 47 % think it does not promote action on climate change , an issue that ranks as Germany 's top international concern .
The way U.S. teens spend their summer hours is changing . Compared with 10 years ago , teens ages 15 to 17 are devoting more of their time in the summer to educational activities and less time to leisure , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data . Teens now spend an average of 39 minutes a day – more than four hours a week – engaged in homework or classwork during the month of July , compared with 22 minutes a decade earlier . ( This analysis of teens ' summer time use is limited to the month of July to avoid capturing experiences during the very end or beginning of the regular school year . ) Teens now spend about seven and a half hours a day engaged in leisure activities during the summer . While this still accounts for the bulk of their waking hours , it represents a 24-minute decline from a decade ago . This decline has been largely driven by a 22-minute drop in time spent socializing or going to entertainment or sporting events . On the flip side , teens now spend 18 more minutes a day in active pursuits such as playing sports or exercising compared with teens a decade ago . What has not changed substantially is the amount of time they spend on screens in the summer : Teens now devote more than three and a half hours a day to activities such as gaming , watching TV , surfing the web and watching videos – a figure that has ticked down only slightly in the past decade .
For instance , just 41 % in the United Kingdom express a favorable opinion of the U.S. , the lowest percentage registered in any Pew Research Center survey there . In France , only 31 % see the U.S. positively , matching the grim ratings from March 2003 , at the height of U.S.-France tensions over the Iraq War . Germans give the U.S. particularly low marks on the survey : 26 % rate the U.S. favorably , similar to the 25 % in the same March 2003 poll . Ratings for U.S. President Donald Trump have been low in these nations throughout his presidency , and that trend continues this year . Trump 's most negative assessment is in Belgium , where only 9 % say they have confidence in the U.S. president to do the right thing in world affairs . His highest rating is in Japan ; still , just one-quarter of Japanese express confidence in Trump .
Multiracial adults see themselves as more open to other cultures and more understanding of people of different backgrounds . Around six-in-ten multiracial Americans ( 59 % ) said their multiracial background has made them more open to cultures other than their own , and 55 % felt that they were more understanding of people of different racial backgrounds . Still , relatively few ( 19 % ) said they had felt like they were a go-between or `` bridge '' between different racial groups .
Among both Gen Zers and Millennials , 53 % say people of different races marrying each other is a good thing for our society , compared with 41 % of Gen Xers , 30 % of Boomers and 20 % of those in the Silent Generation , according to the Center 's 2019 report . Millennials and Generation Z have been at the vanguard of changing views on same-sex marriage . About half of Gen Zers and Millennials say gay and lesbian couples being allowed to marry is a good thing for our society , while 33 % of Gen Xers , 27 % of Boomers and 18 % of Silents say the same , according to the 2019 report .
Differences along racial and ethnic lines are even more dramatic . About half of black fathers ( 47 % ) are living apart from at least one of their children ages 17 or younger , and 36 % are living apart from all of their children . Far lower shares of Hispanic ( 26 % ) and white ( 17 % ) fathers are living apart from one or more of their children .
An estimated 421,000 Hispanics of Venezuelan origin resided in the United States in 2017 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Venezuelans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Venezuelan origin ; this includes immigrants from Venezuela and those who trace their family ancestry to Venezuela . Venezuelans are the 13th-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States , accounting for less than 1 % of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017 . Since 2000 , the Venezuelan-origin population has increased 352 % , growing from 93,000 to 421,000 over the period . At the same time , the Venezuelan foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 313 % , from 75,000 in 2000 to 309,000 in 2017 . By comparison , Mexicans , the nation 's largest Hispanic origin group , constituted 36.6 million , or 62 % , of the Hispanic population in 2017 .
Biden holds a 34-point advantage over Trump among Latino eligible voters , far larger than Biden 's 10-point lead among all U.S. voters . In the new survey , 63 % of Latino voters say they would vote for Biden or lean toward voting for him if the election were held today , while 29 % say they would vote for Trump or lean toward voting for him . In 2016 , Latino voters had similar preferences , according to exit polls and a Pew Research Center study of validated voters . Among Hispanic voters , a higher share of college graduates than those with some college experience or less say they favor Biden , 69 % vs. 61 % . Meanwhile , 67 % of Hispanic women voters and 59 % of registered Hispanic men say they prefer Biden . Biden holds a narrower lead over Trump ( 54 % vs. 37 % ) among Latino registered voters in nine `` battleground '' states – Arizona , Florida , Georgia , Iowa , Michigan , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin .
Much of the recent growth in the foreign-born black population has been fueled by African migration . Between 2000 and 2016 , the black African immigrant population more than doubled , from 574,000 to 1.6 million . Africans now make up 39 % of the overall foreign-born black population , up from 24 % in 2000 . Still , roughly half of all foreign-born blacks living in the U.S. in 2016 ( 49 % ) were from the Caribbean , with Jamaica and Haiti being the largest source countries .
Trust in information from the EU and WHO , while relatively high overall , is even stronger among people with a college degree or higher . About three-quarters of Americans with a postgraduate degree ( 78 % ) or college degree ( 72 % ) say they can believe information coming from the EU about the coronavirus outbreak .
Internet users in emerging countries are relatively advanced in their use of social media , compared with the U.S . Even though a smaller share of adults are online in other countries , those who use the internet are avid social media users . Our latest U.S. survey shows that 73 % of internet users are social networking site users . By comparison , in 20 of 24 nations surveyed , seven-in-ten or more internet users participate in sites like Facebook and Twitter , including slightly less than nine-in-ten internet users in Egypt ( 88 % ) , Russia ( 86 % ) , and the Philippines ( 86 % ) . Only in China do less than a majority of internet users access a social networking site . That means that many of the countries in our global survey show a higher share of internet users as social media aficionados . However , it is important to note that internet access is much less common in all of these emerging and developing countries compared to the U.S. , so as a total proportion of the population social networking usage is still practiced only among a minority in most of the countries surveyed . But those who go online in poorer countries are early adopters and they are enthusiastic to try the newest digital technology applications . Thus , these countries have a relatively modest share of their entire population online , but those who are online are eager for social media to a greater degree than Americans are .
More than half of all tweets sent by members of the U.S. Congress between March 11 and 21 were related to the coronavirus outbreak , reflecting a dramatic increase since late January , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis . The surge in Twitter activity is one reflection of the extent to which COVID-19 has dominated discussion among lawmakers on Capitol Hill in recent weeks .
However , European publics are notably less enthusiastic . In France , home to large demonstrations when the Olympic torch passed through the country , a clear 55 % -majority calls the decision to hold the games in China a mistake . On balance , the British and Spanish approve of holding the event in China , while Germans , Americans and Poles are more divided on this question . And , unlike in other Asian nations , opposition to the Beijing Games runs high in Japan — 55 % of Japanese disapprove of the decision to hold the Olympics there , while just 39 % approve .
The Supreme Court 's pair of decisions on same-sex marriage was the public 's top news story of the week . Three-in-ten ( 30 % ) very closely followed the coverage of these rulings . Fewer ( 19 % ) followed the court 's decision on the 1965 Voting Rights Act . Relative to other major Supreme Court decisions of the last four years , news about the rulings on same-sex marriage attracted about as much interest as the 2012 decision on Arizona 's immigration law ( 29 % very closely ) , but attracted far less attention than the court 's judgment to uphold most provisions of the Affordable Care Act . In June 2012 , 45 % of the public followed this story very closely . Public interest in the court 's decision to overturn parts of the Voting Rights Act ranks in the middle of the pack among major court decisions since 2009 .
There is widespread support across most of the NATO countries surveyed for the use of military force to maintain order in the world . A median of 57 % across 16 member countries agree that military force is sometimes necessary , while a median of 36 % disagree . Across most countries surveyed – both members of NATO and those that do not belong to the organization – about half or more support the use of military force to maintain order . And in seven countries ( Sweden , the U.S. , Canada , the UK , Turkey , Russia and Hungary ) seven-in-ten or more hold this view . Germans are more divided , with 47 % saying that military force is sometimes necessary and a similar 52 % disagreeing with that statement . In Bulgaria , only 38 % say military force is sometimes necessary .
Overall attitudes about tariff increases are little changed since last fall . Republicans and Republican leaners continue to have much more positive views of tariff increases than Democrats and Democratic leaners . About two-thirds ( 67 % ) of Republicans say that tariff increases have been good for the U.S. , while just 26 % say they have been bad for the country ( the share of Republicans saying they have been bad for the country is slightly higher than it was in September ) . By comparison , about eight-in-ten Democrats ( 82 % ) say these increases have been bad for the country , and these views are little changed in recent months .
Police work is marked by conflicting experiences and emotions . While about six-in-ten officers ( 58 % ) say they nearly always or often feel proud about their work , about half ( 51 % ) say it always or often makes them feel frustrated .
7 Most Americans favor allowing unmarried couples to have the same legal rights as married couples . Roughly two-thirds of adults ( 65 % ) say they favor allowing unmarried couples to enter into legal agreements that would give them the same rights as married couples when it comes to things like health insurance , inheritance or tax benefits , while 34 % oppose this . Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party are far more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to favor allowing these types of legal agreements for unmarried couples . About three-quarters of Democrats ( 77 % ) favor this , including 45 % who strongly favor it . By contrast , Republicans are about evenly split : 50 % favor and 49 % oppose this . Party differences are also evident in views concerning the acceptability of cohabitation , the societal benefits of marriage , the impact of cohabitation on the success of a couple 's marriage and whether cohabiting and married couples can raise children equally well .
Digital advertising continues to grow as a proportion of total advertising revenue , a trend driven in large part by growth in advertising on mobile devices . The estimates below are for all digital advertising revenue , not just for news outlets , and thus are an indicator of the general direction of the economic health of the digital realm rather than the digital news sector specifically . ( There is no publicly available economic data specifically for all digital-native news outlets studied above . ) In 2018 , according to eMarketer estimates , digital advertising grew to $ 109 billion , an increase from $ 88 billion in 2017 . It was estimated to comprise 49 % of all advertising revenue , up from 43 % in 2017 .
Nearly half of Republicans with incomes under $ 40,000 ( 47 % ) say that the government does not provide enough assistance for poor people . This is considerably higher than those who make between $ 40,000 and $ 75,000 or $ 75,000 or more ; only about three-in-ten in these income brackets say that poor people do not receive enough assistance ( 32 % and 28 % , respectively ) .
Awareness of contact tracing and perceptions of how often scams happen are linked to the steps people say they would be likely or comfortable to take in the process . Some seven-in-ten U.S. adults had seen or heard a great deal or some about contact tracing at the time this survey was taken in July , whereas three-in-ten ( 29 % ) had heard nothing at all or not too much about this process . Those who had seen or heard not much or nothing at all are least likely to say they would be comfortable or likely to engage with all three contact tracing steps explored here ( `` speak , share , quarantine '' ) .
More whites favor an active U.S. presence in world affairs than blacks or Hispanics . About half of white Americans ( 49 % ) say its best for the country to be active in world affairs , but just 39 % of Hispanics and 29 % of blacks say the same . More educated Americans are the most supportive of an active U.S. presence on the world stage . A strong majority of those with a postgraduate degree ( 66 % ) say the U.S. should be active globally , compared to 29 % saying it should concentrate on domestic problems . Those who have a four-year college degree are more narrowly divided , but a majority favors an active U.S. global role ( 56 % active vs. 40 % pay less attention ) . Americans who have not completed college tend to favor paying less attention to problems overseas and concentrating here at home . Larger shares of those with some college experience ( 52 % vs. 38 % ) and those with a high school degree or less ( 56 % vs. 39 % ) say we should pay less attention overseas than say it 's best to be active in world affairs . Whites without a college degree are skeptical of an active U.S. presence in world affairs . About half of whites without a college degree ( 51 % ) say the U.S. should pay less attention to problems overseas . Most whites with a college degree take the opposite view ( 64 % say U.S. should be active in world affairs ) ; only a third say we should pay less attention to international problems .
A growing share of Americans now use smartphones as their primary means of online access at home . Today roughly one-in-five American adults are `` smartphone-only '' internet users – meaning they own a smartphone , but do not have traditional home broadband service .
The public holds very different views of three world leaders : Vladimir Putin , Benjamin Netanyahu and Angela Merkel . By 69 % to 19 % more hold an unfavorable than favorable view of Russian President Vladimir Putin ; just 13 % do not offer a rating of him . Views of Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are mixed : 34 % view him favorably , while about as many ( 32 % ) view him unfavorably and 33 % are unable to offer a rating . German Chancellor Angela Merkel is not well known to the public : 48 % do not offer a rating of her ; 29 % view her favorably , while 23 % view her unfavorably .
Another kind of survey experiment involves randomly assigning different answer choices to survey questions . A recent survey by the Center asked Americans whether Trump or Democratic congressional leaders should take the lead in solving the nation 's problems . One group of respondents saw only two possible answers : Trump or Democratic leaders . But another group saw an additional answer : both . The experiment showed one consistent pattern : Regardless of the answer options , a greater share of the public said that Democrats should take the lead than said Trump should take the lead . But in the version of the question in which `` both '' was an explicit option , a 54 % majority of Americans chose that response .
1 About a third of Americans ( 35 % ) say they read scripture at least once a week , while 45 % seldom or never read scripture , according to 2014 data from our Religious Landscape Study . Frequency of reading scripture differs widely among religious groups . Majorities of Jehovah 's Witnesses ( 88 % ) , Mormons ( 77 % ) , evangelical Protestants ( 63 % ) and members of historically black Protestant churches ( 61 % ) say they read scripture at least once a week . By contrast , 65 % of Jews say they seldom or never read scripture .
We asked whether people believe that citizens should be able to make public statements that are offensive to minority groups , or whether the government should be able to prevent people from saying these things . Four-in-ten Millennials say the government should be able to prevent people publicly making statements that are offensive to minority groups , while 58 % said such speech is OK .
Half the general public supports allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally , up 15 points from 35 % in 2001 . But just 29 % of Republicans do . Although support among Republicans has been growing , up 8 points from 21 % in 2001 , it 's risen more slowly than in the general public . There is more support for gay marriage among liberal and moderate Republicans ( 42 % ) than among conservative Republicans ( 23 % ) .
As part of the July survey , the Center asked social media users who say they have changed their views about a political or social issue because of something they saw to describe a recent instance when this took place . Some 12 % of these adults say they changed their views – either positively or negatively – about the Black Lives Matter movement or about police brutality and the need for police reform . ( The responses below are lightly edited for spelling , style and readability . )
Republicans and Democrats differ substantially in views of how most of these groups will fare during Trump 's presidency . Sizable majorities of Democrats say a number of groups will lose influence with Trump in the White House : 81 % say the influence of the poor will decline ; 78 % say the same about Hispanics ; 74 % each say women and gays and lesbians will lose influence ; and 73 % say this about blacks . No more than about a third of Republicans say any of these groups will lose influence with Trump in the White House ( 33 % gays and lesbians , 32 % Hispanics ) . Most Republicans expect that these groups will either gain influence or not be affected by Trump 's presidency . On the other hand , 83 % of Democrats expect wealthy people to gain influence in Trump 's presidency , while close to two-thirds say the influence of men ( 65 % ) and whites ( 64 % ) will grow . By contrast , only about four-in-ten Republicans anticipate that the influence of these groups will increase ( 43 % wealthy people , 40 % whites , 36 % men ) .
Yet when asked about specific policies to address the energy supply , a majority of Americans continue to support allowing more offshore oil and gas drilling in U.S. waters ( 56 % ) and more mining and drilling on federally-owned land ( 58 % ) . These opinions are largely unchanged from recent years .
Pew Research surveys have consistently shown strong public support for building the pipeline from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast , with 61 % of Americans favoring it . Fully 84 % of Republicans want to see the pipeline built , but Democrats are more divided , with 49 % in favor and 38 % opposed .
Seven-in-ten Egyptians express a favorable view of the Muslim Brotherhood , down just slightly from 75 % a year ago . Most ( 56 % ) also have a positive opinion of the Brotherhood-affiliated Freedom and Justice Party ( FJP ) , the largest party in the newly elected parliament . The more conservative al-Nour fares less well : 44 % have a favorable and 44 % an unfavorable view of the Salafist party . Hazem Salah Abu Ismail , a Salafist leader who was recently disqualified as a presidential candidate , gets somewhat better ratings ( 52 % positive , 42 % negative ) . The April 6th Movement , a loose organization of mostly young and secular activists that played a key role in the demonstrations that forced Hosni Mubarak from office , is rated favorably by 68 % of Egyptians . However , the Egyptian Bloc , a mostly secular coalition of political parties , is not popular – just 38 % assign it a positive rating .
Some survey respondents noted that with the internet 's many social positives come problems . They said that both scenarios presented in the survey are likely to be accurate , and noted that tools such as email and social networks can and are being used in harmful ways . Among the negatives noted by both groups of respondents : time spent online robs time from important face-to-face relationships ; the internet fosters mostly shallow relationships ; the act of leveraging the internet to engage in social connection exposes private information ; the internet allows people to silo themselves , limiting their exposure to new ideas ; and the internet is being used to engender intolerance .
Comparing online activities for the typical day for broadband users across each community type makes the point more vividly . There is basically no difference for rural broadband users and those in other parts of the country with respect to the number of online activities they do on the average day .
Survey research shows that in recent years support for the free-market system has been on the rise in Eastern Europe , especially in countries such as Poland that have enjoyed impressive economic growth . However , compared with other regions of the world — and in particular , compared with their Western European counterparts — Eastern Europeans embrace free markets somewhat tepidly . A 47-nation 2007 Pew Global Attitudes survey found that , among the seven major world regions included in the study , support for free markets was lowest in Eastern Europe and Latin America . Across the six Eastern European countries surveyed — Bulgaria , Czech Republic , Poland , Russia , Slovakia and Ukraine — a median of 56 % agreed with the statement `` Most people are better off in a free market economy , even though some people are rich and some are poor . ''
An estimated 2.1 million Hispanics of Dominican origin lived in the United States in 2017 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Dominicans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Dominican origin ; this includes immigrants from Dominican Republic and those who trace their family ancestry to Dominican Republic . Dominicans are the fifth-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States , accounting for 4 % of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017 . Since 2000 , the Dominican-origin population has increased 159 % , growing from 797,000 to 2.1 million over the period . At the same time , the Dominican foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 106 % , from 543,800 in 2000 to 1.1 million in 2017 . By comparison , Mexicans , the nation 's largest Hispanic origin group , constituted 36.6 million , or 62 % , of the Hispanic population in 2017 .
Public interest in the Iraq war remained consistent last week . About three-in-ten ( 29 % ) say they followed news from Iraq very closely , while 13 % say it was their top news story of the week . Those numbers are largely unchanged from the previous week . Pope Benedict XVI 's visit to the U.S. was the media 's second biggest story of the week , but generated only modest public interest . Overall , 13 % followed news about the pope 's visit very closely and 6 % called it their top story .
While there is support for making it easy for citizens to vote , the public is largely opposed to making voting required in national elections . Only two-in-ten ( 20 % ) would favor mandatory voting , while nearly eight-in-ten ( 78 % ) says citizens should be able to decide for themselves whether or not to vote in national elections .
About six-in-ten ( 58 % ) say food safety is a very big problem , and 54 % say the same about health care . Roughly four-in-ten or fewer are troubled by people leaving for jobs in other countries ( 38 % ) , traffic ( 33 % ) and electricity shortages ( 31 % ) .
For 18 of 19 programs tested , majorities want either to increase spending or maintain it at current levels . The only exception is assistance for needy people around the world . Nonetheless , as many say that funding for aid to the needy overseas should either be increased ( 21 % ) , or kept the same ( 28 % ) , as decreased ( 48 % ) .
When it comes to workplace automation that has already occurred , Americans are more likely to say it has hurt U.S. workers than helped them . Around half of U.S. adults ( 48 % ) say job automation through new technology in the workplace has mostly hurt American workers , while just 22 % say it has generally helped , according to the 2018 survey . About three-in-ten ( 28 % ) say these advances have neither helped nor hurt U.S. workers .
The Scooter Libby trial – a complex , inside-the-Beltway story – has yet to spark widespread interest among the public . Stories about the trial accounted for 3 - 4 % of the newshole during the last two weeks of January . The Libby trial has been the top news story for just 1 % of the public , and fewer than 10 % have been following it very closely . The public was much more intrigued with the circumstances surrounding the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame back in July 2005 , when Karl Rove was still a central character .
As might be expected , people 's opinions about whether they would gain or lose influence under the incoming president were very different eight years ago . Core GOP groups , especially Republicans ( 60 % ) and Bush voters ( 59 % ) said they would gain influence ; by contrast , 47 % of Gore voters and nearly as many Democrats ( 44 % ) said they would lose influence .
Disclosures about government surveillance prompted some Americans to change the way they use technology . In a survey by the Center in late 2014 and early 2015 , 87 % of Americans said they had heard at least something about government surveillance programs . Among those who had heard something , 25 % said they had changed the patterns of their technology use `` a great deal '' or `` somewhat '' since the Snowden revelations .
Men and women who have used online dating sites and apps hold somewhat differing views about how widespread online harassment is on these platforms , according to the most recent survey . For example , while 32 % of female users say people being harassed or bullied is a very common occurrence on online dating platforms , that share falls to 19 % among male users . These gender differences persist across all age ranges . Similarly , women who have used online dating platforms are more likely than men to say it is very common for people to receive sexually explicit messages or images they did n't ask for ( 55 % vs. 42 % ) . This gender gap is more pronounced among online daters under the age of 50 than among those 50 and older .
Growing share see strong partisan conflicts The nearly two-thirds of Americans who see very strong conflicts between Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. today is up from 56 % who said this in December 2016 and 47 % who said this in December 2012 .
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , conducted Jan. 10 - 15 among 1,708 Americans , finds that despite the sweeping changes in Washington , the public remains dubious about prospects for bipartisanship . Only about a quarter ( 28 % ) believes that relations between the two parties will improve over the next year . And while the new Congress is less than a month old , just 39 % believe Democratic leaders are making an effort to reach out to Republicans on policy solutions , and even fewer see President Bush reaching out to Democrats ( 33 % ) .
Pluralities also say news organizations are giving the right amount of coverage to the situation in Afghanistan ( 42 % ) and news about the federal budget deficit and national debt ( 44 % ) . Relatively few see either story receiving too much coverage ( 12 % Afghanistan , 11 % federal budget deficit and national debt . )
Most black and Asian adults ( 63 % and 66 % , respectively ) say race or race relations come up in their conversations with family and friends at least sometimes , compared with about half of white ( 50 % ) and Hispanic ( 49 % ) adults . Blacks are more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to say these topics come up often ; 27 % of black adults say this compared with 11 % of white , 15 % of Hispanic and 13 % of Asian adults .
Overall , global publics tend to express positive views about China . A median of 47 % across the 38 nations polled have a favorable opinion of China , while 37 % have an unfavorable one . Global ratings for the U.S. , which have declined sharply in the first year of the Trump administration , look very similar : A median of 49 % see the U.S. in a positive light , while 39 % offer an unfavorable view . ( For more on global views of the U.S. , see `` U.S . Image Suffers as Publics Around World Question Trump 's Leadership . '' )
About a quarter of Hispanics who cast a ballot in 2018 ( 27 % ) said they were voting in a midterm for the first time , compared with 18 % of black voters and 12 % of white voters , according to the exit polls . Meanwhile , many new voters this year were young . A majority of voters younger than 30 said they were voting in a midterm for the first time . ( Note : This item has been corrected . See details at end of post . )
Several Asian countries have greater confidence in Trump than in Chinese President Xi Jinping . While Trump faces low global confidence overall , greater shares of people in the Philippines , Vietnam and Japan are confident in Trump than in China 's leader . ( Within the region , Filipinos had the highest confidence in Xi , at 53 % , while the Japanese had the lowest at 11 % . ) In contrast , people in South Korea were more than twice as likely to have confidence in Xi than Trump regarding world affairs ( 38 % versus 17 % ) .
Overall , 52 % of adults say they `` feel more comfortable using familiar brands and products , '' and 39 % describe themselves as preferring to wait until they hear about others ' experiences before trying something new themselves . Similarly , 39 % say they prefer their `` tried and trusted '' brands . But 35 % of Americans say they like the variety of trying new products , and three-in-ten like being able to tell others about their experiences with new technology . About one-in-six adults ( 15 % ) say they usually try technology products before others do .
Europeans are by far the most dissatisfied : A median of 70 % in six countries say current economic conditions in their countries are bad . The Italians ( 88 % ) , French ( 85 % ) and Spanish ( 81 % ) are the most downbeat . Only the Germans are particularly satisfied , with 75 % believing their economy is in good shape . Similarly , Latin Americans ( median of 63 % ) say their economy is in bad shape . Brazilians ( 87 % ) and Venezuelans ( 83 % ) have particularly negative views .
4 About half of post-9/11 veterans say readjusting to civilian life was difficult . While about three-quarters of all veterans ( 73 % ) say readjusting to civilian life was very or somewhat easy , roughly one-in-four ( 26 % ) say it was at least somewhat difficult . There is a significant gap between pre- and post-9/11 veterans in this regard . About half of post-9/11 veterans ( 47 % ) say it was very or somewhat difficult for them to readjust to civilian life after their military service . By comparison , only about one-in-five veterans whose service ended before 9/11 ( 21 % ) say their transition was very or somewhat difficult . A large majority of pre-9/11 veterans ( 78 % ) say it was easy for them to make the transition .
With the holiday shopping season underway , about twice as many are hearing good news about retail sales ( 28 % ) as bad news ( 13 % ) ; about half ( 48 % ) are hearing mixed news . This sentiment is roughly in line with opinions measured in December of each of the previous two years . Despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading near record highs , attitudes are mixed when it comes to recent news about the stock market . Two-in-ten ( 20 % ) say they are hearing mostly good news about the stock market compared with 16 % who are hearing mostly bad news ; 45 % say news has been mixed and 19 % say they do n't know .
The richest families are also the only ones whose wealth increased in the years after the start of the Great Recession . From 2007 to 2016 , the median net worth of the top 20 % increased 13 % , to $ 1.2 million . For the top 5 % , it increased by 4 % , to $ 4.8 million . In contrast , the median net worth of families in lower tiers of wealth decreased by at least 20 % . Families in the second-lowest fifth experienced a 39 % loss ( from $ 32,100 in 2007 to $ 19,500 in 2016 ) .
Of the individual property crimes tracked by BJS , for example , theft is the least likely to be reported to police ( possibly because it is also the most common form of property crime ) . Only 29 % of thefts were reported in 2015 . By comparison , half of household burglaries ( 51 % ) and about seven-in-ten motor vehicle thefts ( 69 % ) were reported .
Partisans also generally agree about their inability to agree on `` basic facts . '' Overall , 73 % of the public – including 77 % of Republicans and 72 % of Democrats – say that voters in both parties `` not only disagree over plans and policies , but also can not agree on the basic facts . ''
The minority groups that carried President Obama to victory yesterday by giving him 80 % of their votes are on track to become a majority of the nation 's population by 2050 , according to projections by the Pew Research Center . They currently make up 37 % of the population , and they cast a record 28 % of the votes in the 2012 presidential election , according to the election exit polls.By 2050 , the Hispanic share of the U.S. population could be as high as 29 % , up from 17 % now . The black proportion of the population is projected to be unchanged at 13 % , while the Asian share is projected to increase to 9 % from its current 5 % . Non-Hispanic whites , 63 % of the current population , will decrease to half or slightly less than half of the population by 2050 .
Rural Indians prefer the BJP , despite Congress ' long ties to the rural poor . The Congress party has long drawn much of its support from rural Indians and has pursued policies to solidify that backing , such as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and the National Food Security program , both of which Indians overwhelmingly favor . Nevertheless , rural Indians favor the BJP , not Congress , to lead the next government by more than three-to-one ( 64 % to 18 % ) , roughly the same proportion as favor the BJP in urban areas .
But , judging by the results of our recently released survey on religion in everyday life , religion does indeed seem to be a subject many people avoid . About half of U.S. adults tell us they seldom ( 33 % ) or never ( 16 % ) talk about religion with people outside their family . And roughly four-in-ten say they seldom ( 26 % ) or never ( 13 % ) discuss religion even with members of their immediate family . So who does talk about religion ? Well , not surprisingly , religious people do . According to the new report , fully two-thirds of highly religious Americans – defined as those who say they pray daily and attend religious services weekly – report that they talk about religion with their immediate families at least once a week , and 43 % say they talk about religion with people outside their families each week . Among less religious Americans , by contrast , just one-in-five ( 19 % ) say they talk about religion with members of their immediate family and only about one-in-ten ( 9 % ) discuss religion with people outside their family each week .
Because no single question can possibly paint a full picture of opinion on an issue , the Pew Research Center covers public policy from multiple angles . On gun policy , we have conducted polls exploring attitudes about a number of proposals , including stricter background checks on gun purchases , preventing people with mental illness from purchasing guns and establishing a federal database to track gun sales . Our January 2013 survey found that many of these proposals drew extensive public support ( see `` In Gun Control Debate , Several Options Draw Majority Support , '' Jan. 14 , 2013 ) . Other recent polls have looked at the differing perspectives of gun owners and non-gun owners and the potential impact of stricter gun laws in a number of areas , including whether such laws would reduce the number of deaths in mass shootings . Even after the Senate defeated a background checks bill in 2013 , we found that 81 % favored making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks ( see `` Broad Support for Renewed Background Checks Bill , Skepticism About Its Chances , '' May 23 , 2013 ) .
But while churchgoing Republicans were particularly skeptical of Trump during the primaries , they are firmly in his corner now that the general election campaign is underway . Indeed , in a June 2016 telephone survey , churchgoing GOP voters were as supportive of Trump in the general election as Republicans who attend religious services less than once a week . Nearly nine-in-ten GOP registered voters who attend religious services weekly say they would vote for Trump over Clinton if the election were held today , including 40 % who say they would `` strongly '' support Trump in the general election . Among GOP voters who attend less regularly , 84 % say they would back Trump if the election were today , including 41 % who support him `` strongly . ''
Overall , 55 % say that problems in the world would be even worse without U.S. involvement , compared with fewer ( 38 % ) who say U.S. efforts to solve problems around the world usually end up making things worse . Views on this question are unchanged from March of last year , the first time it was asked by the Pew Research Center .
Overall , the public continues to express negative views of the news media . Fully 70 % say the news media have a negative effect on the way things are going in the country , while just 22 % say the media have a positive effect .
Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are largely united in backing a $ 15 an hour federal minimum wage : 86 % favor this , including nearly six-in-ten ( 59 % ) who say they strongly support it .
As we saw with the other connected viewing experiences discussed above , younger cell owners are more likely than their elders to engage with others around televised content . This is especially true for posting one 's comments online and for sharing text messages with others watching the same program—for each of these activities , the youngest cell owners ( those ages 18 - 24 ) stand out even compared with those just a few years older .
Part of these cross-country differences may stem from differences in which group people were asked about , given that past Pew Research Center analysis has shown that people tend to express much more support for taking in refugees fleeing violence and war than for immigrants moving to their country . Still , even across the three countries asked specifically about refugees – Jordan , Kenya and Lebanon – opinion differed substantially . For example , 76 % of Jordanians had a favorable view of refugees living in their country , compared with 58 % of Kenyans and 27 % of Lebanese .
According to a September 2011 Pew Research survey , 95 % of Americans born in 1955 or earlier said they could recall exactly where they were or what they were doing when Kennedy was killed . That compares with 81 % of adults asked in 2011 who remember those details when Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011 , and 72 % when Martin Luther King , Jr. was killed in 1968 , according to the same survey . The only other event that weighed on American consciousness to such an extent was the 9/11 terrorist attacks ( 97 % ) . ( Survey questions were filtered to people who were at least eight years of age at the time of each historical event . )
A 54 % majority of women voters say they support or lean toward the Democratic candidate in their district , while 38 % favor the Republican . Among men voters , by contrast , 49 % favor the Republican , while 43 % support the Democrat . The gender divide is much wider among younger voters – those under 35 – than among voters 35 and older .
When asked if being a member of the post-World War II security alliance was good or bad for the U.S. , 77 % said it was a good thing . Only 16 % said membership was a bad thing . Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has raised questions about the relevancy of NATO . An April Pew Research Center survey of Americans found that those who supported him in the primaries were more likely than voters who supported the other candidates to express skepticism about NATO 's benefits to the U.S. Three-in-ten Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters who backed Trump in the primaries said being a member of NATO is bad for the U.S . Yet , a clear majority of his primary supporters still voiced the opinion that NATO membership is good for the country ( 64 % ) .
When it comes to socializing and communicating with friends , young Latinos ( ages 16 to 25 ) make extensive use of mobile technology . Half say they text message ( 50 % ) their friends daily , and 45 % say they talk daily with friends on a cell phone . Other communication platforms are less widely used for socializing . For example , fewer than one-in-five young Latinos ( 18 % ) say they talk daily with their friends on a landline or home phone , and just 10 % say they email their friends daily . These findings are based on a new analysis of data from a nationwide telephone survey of Latinos conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center , a project of the Pew Research Center .
Majorities also oppose reducing military defense spending ( 56 % ) and funding for scientific research ( 54 % ) . Opinion is divided over reducing funding to help low-income Americans ( 50 % disapprove vs. 43 % approve ) . There also is resistance to making changes in Social Security and Medicare to reduce the debt and deficit : 57 % oppose raising the amount Medicare recipients contribute to their health care , while 56 % disapprove of gradually raising the Social Security retirement age . About as many disapprove ( 47 % ) as approve ( 49 % ) of reducing Medicare benefits for higher-income seniors .
The survey includes two questions designed to test understanding of scientific processes . Six-in-ten Americans ( 60 % ) can identify that adding a control group is the best of four options to use to test whether an ear infection medication is effective . And 52 % correctly identify a scientific hypothesis about a computer slowing down .
Catholics ' views on these and similar questions may reflect the fact that American Catholics themselves are experiencing family life in all its modern complexity . One-quarter of Catholics say they have been divorced , including one-in-ten who are now remarried . And fully 44 % of U.S. Catholics say they have lived together with a romantic partner outside of marriage at some point in their lives , including 9 % who are currently cohabiting .
As the eight years of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva 's presidency draw to a close , Brazilians offer largely positive assessments of where their country stands . At a time when global publics are mostly glum about the way things are going in their countries , half of Brazilians say they are satisfied with national conditions , and 62 % say their nation 's economy is in good shape . Of the 21 other publics included in the 2010 Pew Global Attitudes survey , only the Chinese are more upbeat about their country 's overall direction and economic conditions . A solid majority of Brazilians believe the outgoing president and the national government are having a good influence on the country , and most give the government good ratings for its handling of the economy . Moreover , the Bolsa Família program , Lula 's signature initiative , which provides cash incentives to the country 's poorest families for keeping their children in school and getting them vaccinated , is popular with Brazilians among all demographic groups .
A 2020 Pew Research Center survey asked respondents about their confidence in certain groups and institutions to act in the best interests of the public . Out of the 10 groups and institutions included in the survey , Americans are most likely to express confidence in medical scientists , scientists and the military .
In the same survey , Republicans were far more likely than Democrats to express confidence that the election will be conducted fairly and that all citizens who want to vote will be able to do so . Overall , majorities of Americans said they are at least somewhat confident that the election will be conducted fairly and accurately ( 59 % ) and that all citizens who want to vote will be able to do so ( 63 % ) . But Republicans were far more likely than Democrats to express confidence on both fronts . Three-quarters of Republicans expressed confidence that the election will be fair and accurate , compared with 46 % of Democrats . An even larger majority of Republicans ( 87 % ) said they are confident that all citizens who want to vote will be able to , compared with just 43 % of Democrats .
In views of U.S. priorities for the Middle East , fully 81 % say that preventing the spread of terrorism should be a very important goal of U.S. policy . Large majorities also say that preventing attacks on civilians and keeping oil prices low should be very important goals ( 67 % each ) .
Crime and corruption , common scourges of modern societies , top the list of problems cited by publics in emerging and developing nations . A median of 83 % of people across 34 emerging and developing economies say crime is a very big problem in their country , and 76 % say the same about corrupt political leaders . Many also worry about issues such as health care , poor quality schools , water and air pollution , and food safety . Generally , electricity shortages and traffic are seen as less pressing issues .
More see China as the world 's leading economic power than the U.S . In every European country surveyed , a plurality or majority say China is the top economy in the world . Only in South Korea , Japan and the U.S. itself do more people name the U.S. Across Europe , these ratings are largely unchanged since 2019 despite the major changes in the global economy brought on by the coronavirus pandemic . Western Europeans have generally considered China 's economy to be the strongest worldwide in recent years , even while people in Central and Eastern Europe , Latin America , Africa and the Middle East – none of which were surveyed this year – have often named the U.S .
It 's been nearly a year since former Egyptian president and Muslim Brotherhood leader , Mohamed Morsi , was removed from power by the country 's military , following huge demonstrations in Cairo and throughout the nation . On May 26 - 27 , presidential elections will be held in Egypt , whose fairness has already been questioned and which will almost certainly result in victory for Abdel Fattah El-Sisi , the former general who led the military takeover . As a new Pew Research Center survey highlights , most Egyptians still favor Morsi 's ouster , but the public mood is grim , and Sisi 's support is limited . A slim majority ( 54 % ) of Egyptians have a positive opinion of Sisi , and the same percentage say they favor last July 's military takeover that dislodged President Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood from power . These slender majorities may be lower than some expected , given that media reports from Egypt over the last year have often emphasized Sisi 's popularity and broad support for the takeover .
Some 15 % of online adults1 use Twitter as of February 2012 , and 8 % do so on a typical day . Although overall Twitter usage has nearly doubled since the Pew Research Center 's Internet & American Life Project first asked a stand-alone Twitter question in November 2010 , the 15 % of online adults who use Twitter as of early 2012 is similar to the 13 % of such adults who did so in May 2011 . At the same time , the proportion of online adults who use Twitter on a typical day has doubled since May 2011 and has quadrupled since late 2010—at that point just 2 % of online adults used Twitter on a typical day .2 The rise of smartphones might account for some of the uptick in usage because smartphone users are particularly likely to be using Twitter .
Most Democrats want party leaders to `` stand up '' to Trump . As was the case a year ago , a majority of Democrats ( 70 % ) want their party 's leaders to `` stand up '' to Trump this year , even if it means less gets done in Washington ; just 26 % want them to try as best they can to work with Trump , even if it means disappointing some groups of Democratic supporters . A year ago , 63 % of Democrats wanted their party 's leaders to stand up to the president . Among Republicans , the share saying Trump should stand up to Democrats has increased from 40 % a year ago to 51 % currently .
The institution 's strongest backers are the Poles ( 72 % ) and the Hungarians ( 61 % ) . In many other nations , support is tepid . Just 27 % of the Greeks , 38 % of the French and 47 % of the Spanish have a favorable opinion of the EU . Notably , 44 % of the British view the EU favorably , including 53 % of the Scottish .
While public opinion about labor unions may have improved , the news about membership has not . The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported earlier this year that overall union membership in 2012 declined to 11.3 % of the workforce , from 11.8 % in 2011 to 11.3 % . The falloff in union membership has been continuous since 1983 , the first year for which the BLS says there is comparable data . In that year , the union share of wage and salary workers was 20.1 % . The number of union workers is bolstered by membership of public-sector workers . Their membership rate was 35.9 % , five times higher than the share of workers in the private sector ( 6.6 % ) . But public sector unions are facing their own challenges , ranging from widespread layoffs by state and local governments due to austerity measures forced upon them by the economy , to measures passed in some states , such as Michigan and Wisconsin , cutting back the power of unions representing state workers .
On a typical day , 21 % of adults search for product information online . This is an increase from 15 % in 2007 and 9 % in 2004 .
Partisanship is a key factor in views about the issue . Fully 73 % of Democrats say they strongly or somewhat approve of social media companies labeling posts on their platforms from elected officials as inaccurate or misleading . On the other hand , 71 % of Republicans say they at least somewhat disapprove of this practice . Republicans are also far more likely than Democrats to say they have no confidence at all that social media companies would be able to determine which posts on their platforms should be labeled as inaccurate or misleading ( 50 % vs. 11 % ) .
In the U.S. , Hispanic identity fades across generations as distance from immigrant roots grows . High intermarriage rates and declining immigration are changing how some Americans with Hispanic ancestry see their identity . Most U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestry self-identify as Hispanic , but 11 % , or 5 million , do not . While nearly all immigrant adults from Latin America or Spain say they are Hispanic , this share decreases by the third and fourth or higher generations .
There is a general lack of confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping . A median of 34 % across the countries surveyed voice confidence in Xi , while 56 % lack confidence in him . This puts him slightly ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin ( 30 % ) and U.S. President Donald Trump ( 27 % ) in international confidence ratings , but behind German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron . Xi 's strongest backers are in the Philippines ( 58 % ) , Kenya , Nigeria and Tunisia ( all 53 % ) , and Russia ( 50 % ) . Confidence in Xi is particularly low in Europe . Just 9 % of Poles and 11 % of Greeks trust him . Confidence in Xi in the three sub-Saharan African nations surveyed is higher than in any European country polled . Half of Americans lack confidence in the Chinese leader .
In the face of unprecedented measures to limit social contact at work , at school and on the main streets of communities across the nation , Americans give themselves good marks , with 86 % saying people in their households are `` reacting about right . '' Most also say their local school system is reacting about right ( 86 % ) , and majorities say the same about their local ( 74 % ) or state ( 72 % ) government .
Half of U.S. adults ( 51 % ) who say they attend religious services at least once a month report drinking alcohol in the past 30 days , according to the survey . That compares with roughly six-in-ten ( 62 % ) among people who attend worship services less often or not at all . Similarly , only 13 % of monthly attenders engaged in recent binge drinking – defined as four or more drinks on a single occasion for women and five or more for men – compared with 21 % of less frequent attenders . Among U.S. Christians , for example , Catholics are more likely than Protestants to say they 've consumed alcohol in the past 30 days ( 60 % vs. 51 % ) . Adults who do n't belong to any religion , meanwhile , are more likely ( 24 % ) than both Catholics ( 17 % ) and Protestants ( 15 % ) to have engaged in binge drinking in the past month . ( The survey did not include enough Mormon or Muslim respondents to analyze separately , but both of these religious groups teach their followers to abstain from alcohol . ) Rates of drinking also vary by Protestant subgroup . For instance , two-thirds of white mainline Protestants ( 66 % ) say they 've had alcohol in the past month , compared with roughly half of black Protestants ( 48 % ) and white evangelical Protestants ( 45 % ) . White mainline Protestants ( 21 % ) also are more likely than these two latter groups to binge drink ( 12 % for each ) .
Self-identified liberals make up a larger share of the Democratic Party than they once did . Nearly half of all Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents ( 46 % ) describe their political views as liberal , an increase of 17 percentage points since 2003 . Today , 39 % of Democrats say they are moderate , while just 14 % are conservative .
The partisan leanings of white mainline Protestants and white Catholics mirror those of all whites . Jews remain a solidly Democratic group : Nearly twice as many lean Democratic ( 61 % ) as Republican ( 31 % ) . People with no religious affiliation increasingly lean toward the Democratic Party . Currently , 61 % of those who do not identify with any religion lean Democratic – a 22-year high . Back to top
Historically , women have been more avid users of social media than men – a finding consistent across several Pew Research Center surveys . In fact , in November 2010 , the gender gap was as large as 15 percentage points . More recent data , however , show that these differences are no longer statistically significant . A new Pew Research Center analysis finds that a similar share of men and women say they used social networking sites this year , consistent with what we found in 2014 . Some 73 % of online men use social media , which is on par with the 80 % of online women who say they do so .
The public 's interest in economic news remains moderate and has not grown in recent months . Roughly a quarter of the public ( 27 % ) paid very close attention to economic news last week and 16 % listed this as the story they followed most closely .
There is no consensus on whether society has been too accepting of transgender people or not accepting enough . About four-in-ten adults ( 39 % ) say society has not gone far enough in accepting people who are transgender , while 32 % say society has gone too far and 27 % say it has been about right . Partisanship is at play here as well , as Republicans and Democrats express opposite views . While 60 % of Democrats say society has n't gone far enough , just 12 % of Republicans say the same . Conversely , 57 % of Republicans say society has gone too far , compared with 12 % of Democrats .
A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that about half of Americans ( 53 % ) say most people in our society these days look up to men who are manly or masculine , with women more likely than men ( 62 % vs. 43 % ) and Democrats more likely than Republicans ( 58 % vs. 47 % ) to hold this view . About two-thirds of men who say society looks up to masculine men ( 68 % ) say this is a good thing ; a narrower majority of women ( 56 % ) say the same . Views differ more widely along party lines : Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who say society values masculinity , 78 % say this is a good thing , compared with 49 % of their Democratic and Democratic-leaning counterparts .
About seven-in-ten ( 69 % ) black men say religion is very important to them , compared with 80 % of black women . But black men place more importance on religion than white women ( 55 % ) and Hispanic women ( 65 % ) , according to the 2014 Religious Landscape Study . The same dynamic holds true when it comes to belief in God . Roughly eight-in-ten ( 78 % ) black men say they believe in God with `` absolute certainty , '' a higher level of belief than is found among white women ( 67 % ) and Hispanic women ( 65 % ) , though , again , lower than the level of belief seen among black women ( 86 % ) .
Americans are much less likely to see Germany in this way – only 12 % name Germany as one of America 's top two partners . Still , Germany does make the top four , trailing Great Britain ( 33 % ) and China ( 24 % ) and tying with Israel ( 12 % ) .
Family caregiving responsibilities , particularly motherhood , can lead to interruptions in career paths for women and can have an impact on long-term earnings . In a 2013 survey , women were more likely than men to say they had taken breaks from their careers to care for their family . Roughly four-in-ten mothers said that at some point in their work life they had taken a significant amount of time off ( 39 % ) or reduced their work hours ( 42 % ) to care for a child or other family member . Roughly a quarter ( 27 % ) said they had quit work altogether to take care of these familial responsibilities . Fewer men said the same . For example , just 24 % of fathers said they had taken a significant amount of time off to care for a child or other family member .
The overall education gap in views of the stakes of the 2018 midterms is driven largely by divides among those who support Democratic candidates for Congress in their district . Overall , 85 % of Democratic voters with a postgraduate degree say it really matters which party wins control of Congress this fall , compared with 67 % of Democratic voters with no college experience . There are no significant education divides among voters who support Republican candidates for Congress in their district . Younger voters are less likely than older voters to say the 2018 outcome really matters within both party coalitions . But Democratic voters ages 18 to 34 ( 65 % ) are more likely than their young Republican counterparts ( 51 % ) to select the highest importance option on the four-point scale .
Americans overwhelmingly say that parents should be able to take leave from work following the birth or adoption of a child . And they say the same about workers who need to care for a family member with a serious health condition or to deal with their own serious health condition . But while most Americans support paid leave in each of these situations , about one-in-seven ( 15 % ) say men should n't be able to take paternity leave at all , paid or unpaid , according to a new Pew Research Center study .
Still , the U.S. has a relatively strong reputation for respecting personal freedoms compared with the other major nations tested on the survey . A median of 58 % believe the American government respects individual liberties , while 56 % say this about France , 36 % about China , and only 28 % say it about the Russian government .1
Women , who fared better than men in the recession , have not done as well in the recovery . Men realized a gain of 2.6 million jobs from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2011 , compared with only 0.6 million for women . Nonetheless , compared with before the start of the recession in 2007 , employment levels for men are down by more , a loss of 3.4 % for men versus 2.9 % for women . Thus , men still face a steeper climb back .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , many young adults have not given much thought to end-of-life decisions . Just a quarter of adults under 30 say they 've given a great deal of thought to their own wishes for medical treatments at the end of life , while roughly four-in-ten ( 41 % ) say they 've given such matters not much thought or none at all .
By more than two-to-one , Germans ( 55 % to 25 % ) and Americans ( 53 % to 20 % ) say TTIP will be good for their countries . There is no partisan divide in support for TTIP between adherents of the major German political parties , but more Democrats ( 60 % ) than Republicans ( 44 % ) in the United States back the deal .
Just 18 % of registered voters check the description `` someone you admire '' for Clinton and even fewer ( 10 % ) indicate that this description applies to Trump . Few voters also associate the word `` honest '' with either Trump ( 19 % ) or Clinton ( 13 % ) . This also is the case for the phrase `` can unite the country '' – 19 % indicate that this describes Trump , while 17 % check it for Clinton . Clinton is viewed more positively – and less negatively – than Trump in several dimensions . About a third ( 36 % ) checks `` well-informed '' for Clinton , compared with 13 % who do so for Trump . And while 36 % associate the phrase `` willing to work with people they disagree with '' to Clinton , just 20 % indicate that it applies to Trump .
The fact that WhatsApp is better known outside of the U.S. was likely one of the big reasons for Facebook 's move . A median of 78 % of mobile phone owners used their devices to send texts , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted last spring in 24 emerging and developing nations . ( One caveat is that while more than half of the people in each of the countries surveyed own a cell phone , ownership of app-capable smartphones pales by comparison ) .
Last week , the public continued to track economic news more closely than other major stories . More than three-in-ten ( 31 % ) say they followed reports about the condition of the economy most closely , while two-in-ten say they followed reports about the hijacking of a U.S. cargo ship by Somali pirates more closely than any other story . A separate analysis by the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism ( PEJ ) found those two stories received the most coverage as well . Economic news took up 13 % of the newshole ( counting stories about state and local budget troubles separately ) . The standoff between Somali pirates and the U.S. Navy – and its dramatic conclusion on April 12 – took up 14 % .
While at least 13 % of voting members in Congress are immigrants or children of immigrants , relatively few of these are foreign born : 13 in the House , and just one – Sen. Mazie Hirono , D-Hawaii – in the Senate . These 14 immigrant lawmakers represent just 3 % of all voting members in both chambers , a slight uptick from recent Congresses but substantially below the foreign-born share of Congresses many decades ago . ( For example , about 10 % of members in the first and much smaller Congress of 1789 - 91 were foreign born . About a century later , in the 50th Congress of 1887 - 89 , 8 % of members were born abroad , according to a previous analysis . ) The current share of foreign-born lawmakers in Congress is also far below the foreign-born share of the United States as a whole , which was 13.5 % as of 2016 . Immigrants and children of immigrants represent 24 states , with nearly half representing Western states . California has by far the most : 19 of the state 's 55 members are immigrants or children of immigrants . ( Five members of Illinois ' delegation are immigrants or children of immigrants , the second-highest total of any state . ) Looked at another way , more than a quarter of all members of Congress who are immigrants or children of immigrants represent California .
The crown prince also is less trusted than other world leaders . In four of five countries , the share who have confidence in Crown Prince Mohammed is among the lowest , compared with other world leaders asked about in the survey . In Israel , Crown Prince Mohammed earns the least confidence among world leaders by a wide margin , trailing the next-least-trusted leaders , French President Emmanuel Macron , Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin by about 30 percentage points . Confidence in the crown prince is tied with confidence in Trump ( 23 % ) among Lebanese , and , among Americans , Crown Prince Mohammed is tied with Putin at 20 % as the least trusted leaders asked about . In Turkey , similarly low shares express confidence in the crown prince 's judgement in foreign affairs ( 14 % ) and that of Emmanuel Macron ( 14 % ) and Trump ( 11 % ) . Only in Tunisia is Crown Prince Mohammed not at the bottom of the list , beating out Trump by a slim margin .
Overall , 67 % approve of Hillary Clinton 's job performance as secretary of state , while just 25 % disapprove . Fully 91 % of Democrats approve of the way she handled her job as secretary , as do a majority ( 64 % ) of independents . About half of Republicans ( 53 % ) disapprove of her job performance as secretary of state while 39 % approve .
Almost a decade after the global financial crisis rattled national economies , many in the world feel their respective countries ' economies remain weak . A new Pew Research Center survey reveals a bleak picture in parts of Europe , with more than eight-in-ten in Greece , France and Spain describing their country 's economic situation as bad . This gloom is not shared by all in the European Union , however – most Swedes , Germans and Dutch say their economy is doing well . And in China , India and Australia , views are mostly positive . Just three of the 12 nations for which trends are available have seen an increase of public confidence in their national economy in the past year . This mirrors the International Monetary Fund 's projection that 2016 's global growth will be modest and fragile . In two major economies – Canada and Japan – views about economic conditions have become more negative than they were in 2015 .
Two-thirds of DACA recipients are ages 25 or younger , and a majority are women . Women make up a slight majority ( 53 % ) of active DACA recipients , while 47 % are men , according to the tabulations from U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services .
Despite mixed assessments of scientists working on genetic modification , six-in-ten U.S. adults ( 60 % ) say scientists should have a major role in policy issues related to GM foods and 28 % say they should have a minor role . Similar shares of Americans say that small farm owners and the general public should have a major role in GM food policy . A smaller share of Americans says that food industry leaders ( 42 % ) or elected officials ( 24 % ) should have a major role in policy decisions about GM foods .
More than half of immigrants from South and East Asian countries ( 52.1 % ) had a bachelor 's degree or more in 2016 , which is in part explained by Asian countries being the largest source of foreign college graduates who stay to work in the United States . Asian immigrants also make up a majority of H-1B visa holders and foreign students . Latin American immigrants , by contrast , tend to have lower levels of education . The vast majority of Mexican immigrants ( 81.2 % ) and Central American immigrants ( 74.6 % ) had a high school degree or less , the lowest educational attainment level of any origin region .
Since we began polling the Turkish people in 2002 , shortly after the 9/11 attacks , never have more than three-in-ten said they have a favorable view of the U.S . But anti-Americanism really spiked in the aftermath of the 2003 Iraq War , when 83 % of Turks held a negative view of America . Today , only 19 % in Turkey like the U.S. , while nearly three-quarters ( 73 % ) share a dislike of their NATO ally . ( Unfortunately , we do not have comparable data for American views of Turkey ) . But Turkish distaste for foreign powers does not begin and end with the U.S. On balance , around two-thirds or more Turks express unfavorable views of the European Union , China , Brazil , Russia , Iran and Israel . Turks even dislike Saudi Arabia ( 53 % unfavorable and , notably , the highest favorability percentage ( 26 % ) among all countries we asked about ) . The people of Turkey also hold negative views toward NATO specifically ( 70 % dislike the organization ) . In fact , it is hard to find any country or organization the Turkish people really like , except , of course , Turkey itself . According to our spring 2012 poll , 78 % of Turks said they had a favorable view of their country .
Starting as early as 2010 , more Asian immigrants than Hispanic immigrants have arrived annually in the U.S. , a reversal of historical trends . In the early 2000s , the number of newly arrived Hispanic immigrants greatly outnumbered newly arrived Asian immigrants . Around the time of the Great Recession , Latin American immigration declined sharply , especially from Mexico .
A search of the LexisNexis database of 15 of the nation 's largest newspapers from Jan. 1-Sept. 27 , 2013 , identified 335 stories that talked about the 2016 campaign . That is more than double the coverage the 2012 campaign received ( 132 stories ) during the first nine months in 2009 . One reason for lighter coverage four years ago was that the 2012 election featured an incumbent president with no significant challengers within his party , so attention was focused almost solely on the Republican side .
Attending a political campaign event or speech is the second most common type of participation among those surveyed – a median of 33 % have done this at least once . Fewer people report participating in volunteer organizations ( a median of 27 % ) , posting comments on political issues online ( 17 % ) , participating in an organized protest ( 14 % ) or donating money to a social or political organization ( 12 % ) .
The new Republican-led Congress is drawing harsh reviews from the public – including most Republicans . Just 23 % of Americans say congressional Republicans are keeping the promises they made during last fall 's campaign , while 65 % say they are not . Nearly four-in-ten ( 37 % ) say the new Congress has accomplished less than they expected , while 4 % say it has accomplished more than expected . About half ( 53 % ) say its accomplishments are in line with what they expected .
Among American adults as a whole – including those who attend worship services and those who do n't – majorities say that religious organizations should stay out of politics and that they should n't endorse political candidates . Around three-quarters of U.S. adults ( 76 % ) say churches and other houses of worship should not come out in favor of candidates during elections . Protestants in the historically black tradition ( a majority of whom are Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party ) and evangelical Protestants ( a majority of whom are Republican or lean toward the Republican Party ) are more inclined than other major U.S. religious groups to say church endorsements are OK .
A majority of Americans ( 57 % ) say they know only some of their neighbors ; far fewer ( 26 % ) say they know most of them . Americans ages 65 and older are more likely than those ages 18 to 29 to say they know most of their neighbors ( 34 % vs. 20 % ) . In contrast , about a quarter ( 23 % ) of adults under 30 do n't know any of their neighbors , compared with just 4 % among those 65 and older .
Last week 's report on unemployment underscored the catastrophic impact the coronavirus outbreak has had on the U.S. economy . The focus in many states has now turned to reopening businesses and getting people back to work . However , most Americans – including 68 % of those who have lost their jobs or taken a cut in pay due to the coronavirus outbreak – are concerned that state governments will lift restrictions too quickly , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . A similar share of Americans whose jobs were not affected say the same ( 69 % ) . On the other hand , only about three-in-ten U.S. adults in these categories expressed more concern that restrictions would not be lifted quickly enough .
Finally , there are some similarities between what Americans think about these three potential , future enhancements and their attitudes toward the kinds of enhancements already widely available today . Many are skeptical about the need for cosmetic procedures and other current enhancements . For example , 61 % of Americans say people are too quick to undergo cosmetic procedures to change their appearance in ways that are not really important . Roughly a third ( 34 % ) say elective cosmetic surgery is `` taking technology too far . '' And , overall , 54 % of U.S. adults say elective cosmetic surgery leads to both benefits and downsides for society , while 26 % express the belief that there are more downsides than benefits , and just 16 % say society receives more benefits than downsides from cosmetic surgery .
A majority of the public has at least some confidence in the Secret Service to improve its job performance . About seven-in-ten , including roughly equal shares of Republicans and Democrats , say they have a great deal ( 19 % ) or fair amount of confidence ( 50 % ) in the agency to improve the job it does providing security . Roughly three-in-ten offer not too much confidence ( 21 % ) or no confidence at all ( 8 % ) in the agency to get better .
Despite the prominence of immigration issues in last year 's presidential campaign , U.S. Hispanics do not rate them a top issue for the new administration or Congress , a pattern similar to that found in previous years of polling by Pew Research Center . According to the new survey , 46 % say dealing with the issue of immigration should be a top priority for the new administration and Congress in 2017 , ranking last among the five priorities tested in the new survey . Instead , Hispanics identify education as a top priority issue for the new Trump administration and for the new Congress among those tested . Fully 73 % say improving the educational system should be a top priority in 2017 . Other top priorities include defending the country from future terrorist attacks ( 69 % ) and strengthening the nation 's economy ( 66 % ) . Following these three issues is reducing health care costs ( 54 % ) .
With the media and the public so highly focused on the economy and the presidential campaign last week , other news stories attracted relatively little attention . While 29 % of the public say they followed news about the current situation in Iraq very closely , only 2 % listed this as the single news story they were following more closely than any other . The media devoted 1 % of its overall coverage to events in Iraq .
There 's an enthusiasm gap . Typically , but not always , Republicans vote at higher rates than Democrats in congressional elections . And at this early stage , that seems likely to happen again , perhaps at an even greater rate than usual . One telling indicator came in December , when the Pew Research Center found that Republicans are much more optimistic about their party 's electoral prospects than Democrats are . Fully 55 % of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters expect the GOP to do better in 2014 than the party has in recent elections , while only 43 % of Democrats expressed such confidence .
Few Nigerians are satisfied with the state of their democracy . Only 39 % of Nigerians are satisfied with the way democracy is working in their country , while 60 % say they are not satisfied . This negative sentiment is similar to what was found in 2017 but is slightly improved from 2013 , when Goodluck Jonathan was president and 72 % were dissatisfied with the way democracy was working .
In much of Eastern Europe , there is now greater acceptance of post-communist political changes compared with Pulse of Europe surveys conducted by the then-Times Mirror Center for the People & the Press in 1991 , as the Soviet Union was collapsing . Even so , the legacy of communism is apparent in the attitudes of many Eastern European publics . Only about half of those in Ukraine and Russia approve of the political changes that have occurred since the collapse of the Soviet Union .
But artificial additives are far from the only ingredient that people restrict in their diet . About four-in-ten Americans ( 38 % ) report limiting sugar intake and about three-in-ten limit salt ( 29 % ) or fat ( 28 % ) .
Among those who often or sometimes have contact with immigrants who speak little or no English , fewer say this bothers them today ( 26 % ) than did so in 2006 ( 38 % ) or in the 1990s .
The large drop in new arrivals is almost entirely due to a drop in the number of Mexican unauthorized immigrants coming to the U.S . In 2017 , Mexicans accounted for 20 % of unauthorized immigrants who came to the U.S. in the previous five years , compared with 52 % in 2007 . This represents a decrease in the average annual inflow of Mexican unauthorized immigrants , from about 375,000 per year in 2002 - 2007 to about 90,000 per year for 2012 - 2017 . For other regions of birth , the average annual inflows did not change significantly , but the shares of the total increased due to declining Mexican arrivals .
There is a sharp partisan divide when it comes to Canadians ' opinions of the U.S . Followers of the incumbent Conservative Party of Canada ( CPC ) , led by current Prime Minister Stephen Harper , have the most positive views of the U.S. ( 84 % ) . Among those who support the Liberal Party , 71 % give the U.S. a thumbs-up . But among backers of the social-democratic New Democratic Party ( NDP ) , only 58 % have a favorable view of America . Despite these differences , majorities of all political stripes in Canada still have a favorable view of the U.S .
Among Republicans and leaners under 40 , 68 % say nominating more racial and ethnic minorities would help and 64 % say the same about more women nominees . Far fewer Republicans 40 and older view these steps as helpful : 49 % say nominating more racial and ethnic minorities would help and 46 % say the same of nominating more women .
In a survey conducted in fall 2018 , more than four-in-five Lebanese adults ( 84 % ) said they use WhatsApp , the highest rate among 11 emerging economies included in the survey . It is the most commonly used social network or messaging platform in Lebanon , beating out Facebook , Instagram and other platforms .
Overall , 39 % say it has contributed a lot to encouraging interest in science , 35 % say it has contributed some while 22 % think it has contributed not much or nothing . Nearly as many ( 38 % ) say the space program has contributed a lot to scientific advances that all Americans can use , while 34 % think it has done a lot for feelings or pride and patriotism .
More than eight-in-ten voters say the economy ( 86 % ) and jobs ( 84 % ) are very important issues in deciding who to vote for this fall . Roughly three-quarters also cite the federal budget deficit ( 74 % ) , health care ( 74 % ) and education ( 72 % ) as top voting priorities . Near the bottom of the list are some of the hot-button social issues . Just 28 % say that gay marriage is a very important issue , and 34 % rate birth control as a top issue .
Republicans ( 21 % ) are somewhat more likely than Democrats ( 15 % ) to say that the pandemic has financially helped news organizations a little or a lot . The same pattern appears in the shares who say it has not had much economic impact ( 21 % of Republicans say no impact vs. 15 % of Democrats ) .
Israel 's deadly interception of a flotilla of boats carrying supplies to Gaza attracted far more coverage ( 13 % of the newshole ) but somewhat less public attentiveness . While 22 % say they followed this story very closely , just 4 % say this was the news they followed most closely . A matching number say they followed the National Hockey League 's Stanley Cup finals most closely ; 7 % say they followed this news very closely . Stanley Cup stories made up less than 1 % of newshole measured by PEJ . Just 1 % says they followed news about the separation of former Vice President Al Gore and his wife , Tipper , more closely than any other story ; 7 % followed this story very closely . Stories about the breakup of the 40-year marriage accounted for 1 % of coverage .
When it comes to the likelihood of cyberattacks , most say that an attack where sensitive national security information will be accessed is either very or somewhat likely ( or volunteer that this has already happened ) . A median of 74 % across the 26 countries hold this view .
Obama is rated favorably by 76 % of Latino registered voters , making him much more popular among that voting group than McCain ( 44 % favorable ) and President Bush ( 27 % favorable ) . Hillary Clinton 's ratings among Latino registered voters are 73 % favorable and 24 % unfavorable ; Obama 's are 76 % favorable and 17 % unfavorable .
Americans tend to view the impact of the internet and other digital technologies on their own lives in largely positive ways , Pew Research Center surveys have shown over the years . A survey of U.S. adults conducted in January 2018 finds continuing evidence of this trend , with the vast majority of internet users ( 88 % ) saying the internet has , on balance , been a mostly good thing for them personally .
Still , some social media users are ambivalent about seeing these types of posts or find them enjoyable . About four-in-ten say they do n't feel strongly about encountering these discussions , while a much smaller share ( 15 % ) say they like seeing lots of political posts on social media .
Saudi Arabia has a young and rapidly growing Muslim population . The kingdom has more than 30 million inhabitants , and roughly 93 % of them are Muslim , according to Pew Research Center data . The country is officially a Muslim nation and most Saudi Muslims are Sunni . However , a Shia minority accounts for an estimated 10 % to 15 % of the population . Additionally , Saudi Arabia is a young country : In 2015 , about 56 % of the kingdom 's Muslims were under the age of 30 . The number of Muslims in Saudi Arabia is projected to increase 51 % between 2015 and 2050 , though their share of the global Muslim population is expected to remain small at about 2 % .
Overall , 47 % of smartphone job seekers say their phone is `` very important '' in helping them look for job and career resources , and an additional 37 % describe it as `` somewhat important . '' But despite the overall significance of smartphones to these users , many of them have encountered challenges navigating the job search process on a mobile device . Nearly half of smartphone job seekers have had problems accessing job-related content because it was n't displaying properly on their phone or had difficulty reading the text in a job posting because it was not designed for a mobile device . And more than one-in-three have had trouble entering a large amount of text needed for a job application or had difficulty submitting the files or other supporting documents needed to apply for a job .
Globally , a median of just 40 % think media organizations should be able to publish information about sensitive issues related to national security , while 52 % believe it is acceptable for the government to suppress such information . But opinions vary widely across countries and regions . Latin Americans and Europeans tend to think the press should be allowed to publish sensitive national security information , while Middle Easterners , Asians and Africans mostly oppose this idea . On this issue , most Americans support government limitations on press freedom – 59 % say the government should be allowed to stop this type of publication .
Like the U.S. population as a whole , Latinos are feeling the sting of the economic downturn . Almost one-in-ten ( 9 % ) Latino homeowners say they missed a mortgage payment or were unable to make a full payment and 3 % say they received a foreclosure notice in the past year , according to a new national survey of 1,540 Latino adults conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center . Moreover , more than six-in-ten ( 62 % ) Latino homeowners say there have been foreclosures in their neighborhood over the past year , and 36 % say they are worried that their own home may go into foreclosure . This figure rises to 53 % among foreign-born Latino homeowners .
In addition , around six-in-ten black STEM employees ( 57 % ) say their workplace pays too little attention to increasing racial and ethnic diversity . Most whites , Hispanics and Asians , by comparison , believe their employer pays about the right amount of attention to diversity .
The face of the Washington press corps has changed markedly in recent years , transformed by an increase in the number of journalists working for `` niche '' publications and digital startups , while the ranks of reporters working for general interest local newspapers have continued to decline . A new Pew Research Center report – updating findings from a 2009 study of the Washington press corps – tracks the changes and explores the implications for local communities . Credentialed reporters working for trade publications , specialty outlets and other niche news sources now outnumber daily newspaper reporters , according to the U.S. Senate Press Gallery . As recently as the late 1990s , daily newspaper staff outnumbered specialty journalists by more than two to one .
Incomes of middle-class households in the U.S. are greater than the incomes of most Western European middle classes . Financially , the American middle class is ahead of the middle classes in the Western European nations in terms of disposable ( after-tax ) household income , with the exception of Luxembourg . Middle-income households in Luxembourg lived on $ 71,799 annually in 2010 , at the median , followed by $ 60,884 in the U.S . The middle class in Italy lived on a median income of $ 35,608 , the most modest means among the countries analyzed . But lower-income Americans are at the middle of the pack in terms of earnings , lagging behind or barely matching lower-income adults in Luxembourg , Norway , the Netherlands and Denmark . ( Incomes are adjusted for household size , scaled to a household size of three , and expressed in 2011 prices and purchasing power parities ; see the report 's Methodology section for more . )
In the Pew Global Attitudes Project poll , Obama consistently received more positive reviews than either Bush or McCain . In nearly all of the countries surveyed , there was more confidence in Obama than in McCain , and in many countries the gap between the Democratic and Republican nominees was striking . While 84 % of the French who were following the race voiced confidence in Obama , only one-in-three said the same about McCain . Similar gaps were found throughout Europe and in a diverse group of countries .
One frequently cited example of the U.S. turning around its image in a difficult environment is Indonesia , where U.S. humanitarian assistance following the horrific December 2004 tsunami helped improve America 's image in the world 's largest Muslim country . Prior to the tsunami , favorable attitudes toward the U.S. had plummeted in reaction to the Iraq war , however after the tragedy and the influx of American aid favorable views of the U.S. more than doubled , jumping from 15 % to 38 % . Recently , we have seen a similar , although more limited , pattern in Pakistan where American aid following the October 2005 earthquake helped drive favorable opinions of the U.S. up slightly , from 23 % in 2005 to 27 % in 2006 .
Here 's one example : Given the considerable attention that China has received for its investments in Africa , how do people in key African nations see China and its leadership ? As of 2019 , public opinion toward China runs more positive than negative in three sub-Saharan African countries surveyed by the Center : Nigeria , Kenya and South Africa . Majorities in Nigeria and Kenya have a positive impression of China ( 70 % and 58 % , respectively ) , while South Africans are a bit more divided ( 46 % favorable , 35 % unfavorable ) . The pattern is similar when it comes to views of China 's leader , President Xi Jinping . Majorities in Nigeria and Kenya express confidence in Xi to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs ( 61 % and 58 % , respectively ) . Among people in South Africa , 52 % have confidence in Xi while 29 % do not .
Publics place responsibility for dealing with the evolving nature of work on a variety of institutions and actors . Government looms large in the minds of many . Nearly eight-in-ten Argentines say government has a lot of responsibility for ensuring that the nation 's workforce has the right skills and education to succeed in the future , and more than seven-in-ten hold this view in South Africa , Brazil , Greece and Italy . Only in the U.S. do fewer than half believe the government has a lot of responsibility for preparing the nation 's workforce . Schools , according to most , also have a major role to play in preparing workers for the future . Majorities in every country surveyed except Japan believe the educational system has a lot of responsibility for ensuring that the workforce has the proper skills and education for the jobs of the future . This perspective is especially common in Argentina , South Africa and Brazil . Most also see a role for individuals . This is particularly true in the U.S , Argentina and Brazil , where more than seven-in-ten say individuals themselves have a lot of responsibility for making sure they are prepared for the future economy . Again , Japan – where just 39 % express this opinion – is an outlier . Employers are seen as having somewhat less responsibility for making sure the workforce has the education and skills necessary for success . Still , roughly half or more believe employers have a lot of responsibility in Argentina , Brazil , South Africa , Hungary , Italy , the U.S. , Canada and Greece .
More recently , there has been a major shift in attitudes on whether it is immoral to smoke marijuana . Currently , 32 % say that smoking marijuana is morally wrong , an 18-point decline since 2006 ( 50 % ) . Over this period , the percentage saying that smoking marijuana is not a moral issue has risen 15 points ( from 35 % then to 50 % today ) .
About three-quarters of registered voters ( 76 % ) say Clinton has a great deal or fair amount of respect for women , while just half as many ( 38 % ) say this about Trump , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Oct. 20 - 25 . A majority of voters ( 60 % ) say Trump has little or no respect for women , including 36 % who say he has no respect at all for women . Roughly equal shares of women ( 62 % ) and men ( 58 % ) say Trump has little or no respect for women , but women are far more likely to say he has no respect at all : 43 % say this , compared with 29 % of men . There are no significant gender differences in perceptions of Clinton 's respect for women .
Reflecting the modest share of all Twitter users they represent , older adults on Twitter do n't produce a great deal of the total content . But this group is much more inclined to talk about national politics in their tweets than younger users . Those ages 65 and older produce just 10 % of all tweets from U.S. adults , but these older Twitter users contribute 33 % of tweets related to national politics . More broadly , those 50 and older produce 29 % of all tweets but contribute 73 % of tweets mentioning national politics . By contrast , 18- to 29-year-olds produce 20 % of all public tweets from U.S. adults , but just 4 % of political tweets .
And while the broadband gap between rural and non-rural Americans has narrowed over time , rural adults remain less likely to have a high-speed internet connection at home . Seven-in-ten suburban residents and two-thirds of urban dwellers say they subscribe to broadband services at home , compared with 58 % of rural adults , according to a separate Pew Research Center survey conducted in January .
Democrats now hold a 12-point lead ( 52 % to 40 % ) in leaned party identification among those with at least a college degree , up from just a four point gap seen as recently as 2010 ( 48 % to 44 % ) . Much of this advantage has come among adults with post-graduate experience ; currently , 56 % lean Democratic while just 36 % lean Republican . Among those who have received a college degree but have no post-graduate experience , the gap is much narrower : 48 % identify as Democrats or lean Democratic , while 43 % affiliate with the GOP or lean Republican . Back to top
In September 2008 , far more voters ( 72 % ) said they were satisfied with the presidential choices that year . More voters also were satisfied with the candidates in the 2004 ( 66 % ) , 2000 ( 64 % ) and 1996 ( 61 % ) campaigns .
The rise in intense Indian support for trade reflects a widely shared perception that international commerce benefits individuals . Contrary to public opinion in the U.S. , Europe and Japan , a majority of Indians believe trade with other countries leads to an increase in wages ( 57 % ) and creates jobs ( 56 % ) . And such sentiment is up slightly from 2014 . Few Indian adults believe trade kills jobs ( 15 % ) or undermines wages ( 13 % ) . At the same time , roughly half of Indians ( 52 % ) say trade increases prices , a sentiment that is widely shared in other emerging markets yet is contrary to economic theory that international commerce should lead to falling prices .
The latest attempt by Beijing to woo European cooperation in investment partnerships is not China 's first foray into the region . In fact , all 10 countries surveyed have received billions of dollars from China across different industries since 2005 , according to an analysis of American Enterprise Institute 's China Global Investment Tracker .
A majority of Xers also named Clinton as best ( 38 % ) or second-best ( 18 % ) , while 43 % cite Reagan ( 34 % as best , 9 % as second-best ) . Just 23 % of Xers say that Obama is the best or second best president of their lifetimes ; 18 % cite George H. W. Bush and 14 % cite George W. Bush .
For example , among those who have heard of CNN but did not get news there , expressions of trust and distrust are roughly equal – 37 % trust and 33 % distrust . ( Fully 80 % of those who heard of it and consumed it say they trust it . ) PBS , however ( trusted by 84 % of those who got news there in the past week ) , was roughly twice as trusted as distrusted outside its core audience ( 34 % v. 16 % ) .
Among the largest digital-native news outlets – those with a monthly average of at least 10 million unique visitors – 14 % went through layoffs in 2018 , down from 20 % in 2017 .
Public confidence in scientists to act in the public interest has increased in recent years . Overall , 35 % of Americans say they have a great deal of confidence in scientists , up 14 percentage points from 2016 . Americans have about the same level of confidence in scientists as they do in the military – and more than they do in some other groups and institutions , including the news media , business leaders and elected officials .
5 Candidate Donald Trump has drawn attention to the issue of illegal immigration with his proposals to force Mexico to build a wall along the southern border and force deportations of those living in the U.S. illegally . But even before he made immigration an issue , about six-in-ten ( 59 % ) Republicans said in May that their party was not doing a good job representing their views on illegal immigration . This includes about two-thirds ( 65 % ) of Republicans who opposed legal status for undocumented immigrants . More than half ( 55 % ) who did favor a path to legal status also were unhappy with the party .
Students from China , India and South Korea accounted for more than half ( 54 % ) of all newly enrolled foreign students pursuing degrees at U.S. colleges and universities in 2016 .
American public opinion regarding China is roughly divided between those with a favorable ( 39 % ) and those with an unfavorable ( 42 % ) view . U.S. attitudes toward China have changed little since 2007 , when 42 % had a positive and 39 % a negative opinion . Ratings for China are decidedly negative in three of the four Western European countries included in the survey . Fewer than one-in-three respondents in Germany , France or Spain express a positive opinion . Moreover , attitudes toward China have grown more negative in all three countries since last year . This is especially true in France , where China 's favorability rating has plummeted from 47 % to 28 % . This year 's decline continues a slide among Western Europeans over the last few years — since 2005 , China 's favorability score has dropped 30 percentage points in France , 26 points in Spain , and 20 points in Germany . And while a plurality in Great Britain continues to express a positive view , opinions of China there are down significantly from 2005 , when 65 % offered a positive rating .
Only 2 % of foreign policy experts think military rule would be appropriate for governing their countries . Publics across Western Europe and North America roughly mirror experts , with a median of 11 % saying they think a military government would be a good thing . Again , though , support varies across countries . Germany and Sweden are the least positive ( 4 % each ) , while Americans , the French and Italians are the most ( 17 % each ) . As with opposition to a strong leader , those with more education tend to be more opposed to rule by the military across most of the countries surveyed .
Of the referred cases in 2017 , asylum seekers from Haiti ( 8,286 ) had the most applications , followed by Nigeria ( 5,575 ) and Turkey ( 2,197 ) . No country saw a bigger increase in referred applications from 2016 to 2017 than Haiti , which had only 631 referred applications in 2016 . As a result , Haiti accounted for almost a third ( 32 % ) of Canada 's overall increase in referred asylum claims in 2017 .
On the more positive side , about two-thirds of Americans say the statements `` social media highlight important issues that might not get a lot of attention otherwise '' ( 65 % ) and `` social media help give a voice to underrepresented groups '' ( 64 % ) describe social media very or somewhat well . Half of Americans also say the statement `` social media make it easier to hold powerful people accountable for their actions '' describes these platforms at least somewhat well . But even larger shares of the public think these platforms are distractions and that people may be engaging in `` slacktivism '' – a term critics have used to describe activism online . Roughly eight-in-ten Americans ( 79 % ) say the statement `` social media distract people from issues that are truly important '' describes social media very or somewhat well , while a similar share ( 76 % ) say the same about the statement `` social media make people think they are making a difference when they really are n't . '' Democrats are more likely than Republicans to see positive impacts of social media . For instance , three-quarters of Democrats say the statement `` social media highlight important issues that may not get a lot of attention otherwise '' describes these platforms at least somewhat well , compared with 55 % of Republicans . Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say these platforms help give a voice to underrepresented groups ( 75 % vs. 52 % ) and make it easier to hold powerful people accountable for their actions ( 60 % vs. 40 % ) . By comparison , there is more partisan agreement when it comes to some negative aspects of using social media platforms for political engagement . However , Republicans are a bit more likely than Democrats to believe that social media distract people from issues that are truly important ( 82 % vs. 77 % ) or make people think they are making a difference when they really are n't ( 80 % vs. 74 % ) .
For their part , a solid majority of Americans say the U.S. should militarily defend a NATO ally if embroiled in an armed conflict with Russia . Asked about their own country 's obligation under the same scenario , more than half in the Netherlands ( 72 % ) , Poland ( 62 % ) , Canada ( 58 % ) and France ( 53 % ) support living up to their mutual defense commitment as a member of NATO . Just 40 % of Germans back such assistance . In most countries surveyed , the more people perceive Russia as a major threat , the greater their willingness to come to a security partner 's defense .
Half of Americans say they think China will have less influence in world affairs after the coronavirus outbreak than it did before – more than twice as many as expect its influence to grow ( 17 % ) following the crisis ( 31 % expect no real change ) . In comparison , a plurality of Americans expect their own country 's influence to remain largely unchanged ( 41 % ) , while roughly three-in-ten each say U.S. influence will increase ( 29 % ) or decrease ( 29 % ) .
But Republicans and Republican leaners who agree with the Tea Party like some federal agencies as much as Democrats do . In fact , two-thirds or more viewed four federal agencies or departments favorably – the Department of Defense ( 75 % favorable ) , the Centers for Disease Control ( 72 % ) , NASA ( 70 % ) , and the Department of Veterans Affairs ( 67 % ) – we asked about it under its former name , the Veterans Administration . For all four , there were virtually no differences in the opinions of Republicans and Republican leaners who agree with the Tea Party , those who do not and Democrats and Democratic leaners .
Similar to Catholics , white mainline Protestants are ambivalent toward these issues , but they are more open to potential human enhancements in some ways . For instance , a majority ( 56 % ) of white mainline Protestants say gene editing for babies would be no different than other ways humans try to better themselves . Fewer ( 42 % ) say they are crossing a line and meddling with nature . `` I think [ mainline churches ] will see much of this for what it is : an effort to take advantage of these new technologies to help improve human life , '' says Ted Peters , professor of systematic theology at Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary .
To cover lost wages , many leave takers take on debt or use savings . About eight-in-ten leave takers ( 78 % ) who took unpaid or partially paid family or medical leave say they cut back on their spending to compensate for lost wages or salary . Substantial shares also say they used savings set aside for something else ( 50 % ) , used savings set aside for the reason they took leave ( 45 % ) , cut their leave short ( 41 % ) or took on debt ( 37 % ) . A third say they put off paying bills and about a quarter say they borrowed money from family or friends ( 24 % ) or received money they were n't expected to pay back ( 23 % ) . Nearly one-in-five ( 17 % ) say they went on public assistance to cover the lost wages or salary .
Some portions of the social-media public are more likely to engage in this activity than others . Liberals outpace both moderates and conservatives , with about a quarter ( 26 % ) of liberal social media users having changed their pictures in response to an issue or event , compared with 14 % of conservatives and 16 % of moderates . This rises to three-in-ten liberals ages 18 - 49 . These differences hold even when accounting for age , sex , and race and ethnicity . Differences also emerge around gender , race and ethnicity , and age . Specifically , female social media users are more likely to change their profile pictures than men , as are black social media users compared with whites and Hispanics . About one-in-five of users ages 18 - 29 and 30 - 49 did so , compared with 13 % of 50- to 64-year-olds and just 5 % of those 65 and older .
About 750,000 unauthorized immigrants held jobs in industries that produce and distribute food – food production ( 290,000 ) , food processing ( 210,000 ) , food retail ( 170,000 ) and food distribution ( 70,000 ) . During the COVID-19 outbreak , these industries , considered part of the nation 's food supply chain , are considered essential jobs . Unauthorized immigrants in these four industry groups accounted for more than 9 % of workers in these food sectors in 2017 , nearly double their share among all U.S. workers . Together , legal and unauthorized immigrants made up nearly a quarter ( 23 % ) of the nation 's nearly 8.2 million workers in food industries .
3 Married adults have higher levels of relationship satisfaction and trust than those living with a partner . Married adults are more likely than those who are living with a partner to say things are going very well in their relationship ( 58 % vs. 41 % ) . They also express higher levels of satisfaction with specific aspects of their relationship , including the way household chores are divided between them and their spouse or partner , how well their spouse or partner balances work and personal life , how well they and their spouse or partner communicate , and their spouse 's or partner 's approach to parenting ( among those with children younger than 18 in the household ) . When it comes to their sex lives , however , similar shares of married and cohabiting adults ( about a third ) say they are very satisfied .
Congress is back from its Thanksgiving break to continue its `` lame duck '' session — so called because it includes senators and representatives who lost their seats in last month 's elections but whose terms wo n't expire till January . Among the items on the congressional to-do list : keeping the government funded , extending an assortment of expired tax breaks , and voting on nominees for ambassadorships , judgeships and other offices . Our analysis found that lame duck sessions are shouldering more of the legislative workload than they used to . The last Congress ' lame duck , which stretched from November 2012 past New Year 's Day 2013 , passed only 87 public laws , but that was 30.7 % of the Congress ' entire two-year output and 31.3 % of its substantive output ( that is , excluding post-office renamings , National `` fill-in-the-blank '' Week designations and other purely ceremonial legislation ) . In 2010 , the 99 public laws passed during the 111th Congress ' lame duck session accounted for 25.8 % of all that Congress ' laws ( and 29.2 % of its substantive laws ) .
While just 23 % of those who feel mostly Taiwanese have favorable views of mainland China , a majority ( 57 % ) of those who consider themselves both Chinese and Taiwanese feel this way . Those under age 50 hold less favorable views of mainland China , as do men and those with lower levels of education . Opinions differ by age , national identification and political party when it comes to closer relations with mainland China . Younger people ( ages 18 to 29 ) are less likely than their older counterparts to support closer economic or political ties . Those who consider themselves both Taiwanese and Chinese offer much more support ( 81 % ) for closer economic ties than those who feel only Taiwanese ( 37 % ) ; the gap in smaller on the idea of closer Taipei-Beijing political relations ( 62 % vs. 22 % , respectively ) . Party affiliation also plays a role : More than eight-in-ten KMT supporters feel positively about closer cross-strait economic ties , but just about a quarter of DPP backers share this sentiment . A majority of those who do not feel close to any party welcome the idea of greater Taiwan-mainland economic relations . Seven-in-ten of those who feel an affinity for the KMT ( a party that has traditionally encouraged closer ties to mainland China ) embrace the idea of closer political ties with Beijing , compared with 34 % of those who do n't favor any Taiwanese political party ; just 12 % of DPP adherents want to see more political connectedness with the mainland .
Democrats feel warmly toward Clinton , while Republican views of her are very cold . Hillary Clinton is a polarizing figure in U.S. politics . In a survey conducted this spring , Democrats give her an average rating of 73 on a 0-to-100 `` feeling thermometer , '' where 100 is the warmest , most positive rating and zero the coldest , most negative . Republicans , on the other hand , give her an average rating of 12 , and 59 % give her a zero on the scale . Republicans ' deeply negative views of Clinton find a parallel in Democrats ' deeply negative views of Donald Trump , who rates an average of 11 on the scale , with about two-thirds of Democrats giving him a zero rating .
These trends are going to put a lot of pressure on Japan 's working-age population down the line . By 2050 , there will be 72 elderly people ( ages 65 and older ) for every 100 people of working age , doubling the 2010 ratio of 36 per 100 . Indeed , Japan 's old-age dependency ratio is among the highest in the world . Looking at other top economies , Japan 's not alone . Germany 's ratio is projected to be 60 per 100 in 2050 , France 's is 44 , China 's is 39 , and the U.S. 's is 36 .
Among all households headed by those ages 25 and older , median household income ( in 2018 dollars ) increased 13 % from 2012 ( $ 57,100 ) to 2018 ( $ 64,800 ) . The incomes of households headed by adults with a ninth to 12th grade education – but short of a high school diploma – increased 14 % during this span , likely the most of any education group . In contrast , the median income of households headed by adults with at least a bachelor 's degree rose by 8 % .
Using a separate measure , 38 % of Americans say they followed news about the economy very closely , while 33 % say they followed the debate over health care reform very closely and 30 % say they tracked the Winter Olympics very closely . Smaller percentages say they very closely followed the plane crash at the IRS offices in Austin ( 26 % ) , the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan ( 24 % ) and the release of some of the U.S. missionaries accused of kidnapping Haitian children ( 16 % ) .
The term `` Cuban '' is applied to persons who identified themselves as such in responding to a question on Hispanic or Latino origins . This includes both persons born in Cuba and those born elsewhere who identified themselves as being of Cuban origins , e.g . persons of Cuban parentage born in the U.S . The terms `` other Hispanics '' and `` other Latinos '' refer to non-Cubans .
When Americans are asked why more students do n't pursue a degree in science , technology , engineering or math ( STEM ) , they are most likely to point to the difficulty of these subjects , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . About half of adults ( 52 % ) say the main reason young people do n't pursue STEM degrees is they think these subjects are too hard . In the new Center survey , Americans with a college degree or more education are more likely than those with less education to say the main reason is that young people think STEM subjects are too hard ( 63 % vs. 46 % ) . Those without a college degree are about twice as likely as college graduates to say the main reason young people do n't pursue a degree in a STEM field is that they think these subjects are not useful for their careers ( 27 % vs. 13 % ) .
About six-in-ten Republicans and those who lean toward the Republican Party ( 62 % ) say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases . By contrast , 82 % of Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party say abortion should be legal in all or most cases .
Digital ad spending went up 20 % last year , and mobile advertising now tops desktop , but journalism organizations have not been the primary beneficiaries . There was explosive growth in mobile advertising , which increased by 65 % , reaching $ 32 billion – higher than desktop advertising for the first year ever . Almost two-thirds of this $ 60 billion in digital advertising spending ( 65 % ) went to just five technology companies : Google , Facebook , Yahoo , Microsoft and Twitter . Despite this , legacy news gets relatively little boost from this digital boom . Only 5 % of local television stations ' advertising revenue is from digital , according to data from BIA/Kelsey . And while 25 % of publicly held newspapers ' ad revenue is from digital , they actually saw overall digital ad revenue fall by 2 % in 2015 .
An estimated 5.6 million Hispanics of Puerto Rican origin lived in the United States in 2017 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Puerto Ricans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Puerto Rican origin and lived in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia ; this includes those who were born in Puerto Rico and those who trace their family ancestry to Puerto Rico . Since 2000 , the Puerto Rican-origin U.S. population has increased 65 % , growing from 3.4 million to 5.6 million over the period . At the same time , the population of those born in Puerto Rico and living in the 50 states and D.C. grew by 27 % , from 1.3 million in 2000 to 1.6 million in 2017 . By comparison , Mexicans , the nation 's largest Hispanic origin group , constituted 36.6 million , or 62 % , of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017 .
While there is a gap in views among Democrats by level of education , there are no such educational differences among Republicans . Democrats with a college degree take an overwhelmingly negative view of the new tariffs : 89 % of college-educated Democrats think they will be bad for the U.S . Among Democrats without a college degree , a somewhat smaller share ( 70 % ) takes this view .
A majority of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 ( 57 % ) fear a shooting could happen at their school , and most parents of teens share their concern . Nonwhite teens express greater concern over the possibility of a shooting at their school than white teens , and girls are more likely than boys to cite such concern . Most parents also share the concern of a shooting at their children 's school . More than eight-in-ten teens and adults say preventing people with mental illnesses from purchasing guns and improving mental health screening and treatment would be effective at preventing school shootings .
Americans just are n't picking up the phone much anymore . Eight-in-ten Americans say they do n't generally answer their cellphone when an unknown number calls , according to newly released findings from a Pew Research Center web survey of U.S. adults conducted July 13 - 19 , 2020 . But not all Americans are equally likely to ignore these calls . While , at most , a quarter of Americans from any demographic group say they generally answer the phone for an unknown number – and 19 % of U.S. adults overall say they do so – men are more likely than women to answer the phone . And though much has been made of younger adults ' distaste for phone conversations , the survey finds that Americans ages 18 to 29 are more likely to take calls from unknown numbers than those in older age groups . In addition , Hispanic and Black adults are more likely than White adults to say they generally pick up for a number they do n't recognize , as are those living in households with lower income levels compared with those from middle- and higher-income households . The majority of Americans ( 67 % ) say their general practice is to not answer the phone when an incoming call is from an unknown number but to check a voicemail if one is left . The share of Americans who say they generally ignore any voicemail left after not answering a call is relatively low ( 14 % ) but does vary by gender , race and ethnicity , and income level .
Views of how the U.S. compares with other countries have long been divided along partisan lines . But these differences have widened in recent years as Democrats have become more likely to say there are other countries that are better than the U.S . In telephone surveys , the share of Democrats saying this is higher than at any point since the question was first asked by Pew Research Center in 2011 , and there has been a corresponding decline in the share saying the U.S. stands above other nations . Views among Republicans and Republican leaners have held steadier . ( It 's important to note that there is a mode effect on this question . Regardless of partisan affiliation , Americans appear less likely to say the U.S. stands above other countries – and more likely to say other countries are better than the U.S. – in surveys conducted online than by phone . )
Overwhelming majorities say gender equality is important . Across all surveyed countries , around nine-in-ten adults or more say it is very or somewhat important that women have the same rights as men . Women are more likely than men , however , to view gender equality as very important in most countries .
Pakistanis are also more willing to support the army in its fight against terrorist groups in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas than they were in the past . In 2015 , 58 % supported using the army to fight these groups , with only 16 % opposed . Comparable levels of commitment to rooting our terrorists in these areas have not been seen since 2009 , when the question was first asked .
In France , home to Europe 's largest Jewish population , reports of anti-Semitic incidents rose dramatically in 2018 . There were 541 cases reported last year – not as high as in some previous years , but a 74 % increase from 2017 , according to the country 's Ministère de l'Intérieur . And already in 2019 , there have been several new high-profile anti-Semitic incidents , including swastikas being spray-painted on graves in a Jewish cemetery .
Donald Trump is at the head of the Republican field due , in part , to the strength of support from many self-described `` born-again or evangelical '' Christians in the early primary and caucus states , according to the exit polls . His success with evangelicals has surprised many observers because of his background ; he is a thrice-married man who once
At this early point in his term , a plurality ( 42 % ) of Americans say that Trump is `` striking the right balance '' when it comes to Middle East policy . Three-in-ten ( 30 % ) say Trump favors Israel too much , while just 3 % say Trump favors the Palestinians too much ; 25 % do not offer an opinion . Today , nearly half of Democrats ( 46 % ) say Trump favors Israel too much , while just 21 % say he is striking the right balance . In 2010 , more Republicans said Obama supported the Palestinians too much ( 38 % ) than said he struck the right balance .
Though they may be doing their best not to think about it during this last full month of summer , some 55 million children and teens — and more than 20 million college students — are going to be heading back to school in the coming weeks . Taken together , that means about 77 million new and returning students .
Looking at FBI data , we saw that Chicago did indeed have the highest total number of murders of any U.S. city in 2012 . But when adjusting for population , it was far from being the U.S. `` murder capital . '' Topping that list was Flint , Mich. , with 62 murders per 100,000 people .
In both nations , there are partisan differences over what binds the two countries together .1 Among Americans , Republicans clearly see defense ties as most important ( 47 % ) , with 28 % naming economic and trade ties and just 12 % naming shared values . Democrats are almost evenly divided across the three options .
As news of large-scale data breaches and vulnerabilities grows , new findings from the Pew Research Center suggest that growing numbers of online Americans have had important personal information stolen and many have had an account compromised .
People 's views also differ depending on how religious they are . More religious Americans are , on average , less affirming of these enhancements . People high in religious commitment are less likely than those low in religious commitment to want each of these three potential enhancements . And six-in-ten or more of those high in religious commitment consider these enhancements to be `` meddling with nature '' and crossing a line that should not be crossed ( gene editing 64 % ; brain chip implants 65 % ; and synthetic blood 60 % ) . By contrast , majorities of those low in religious commitment are more inclined to see the potential use of these techniques as just the continuation of a centuries-old quest by humans to try to better themselves .
Christians in Western Europe , including non-practicing Christians , believe in a higher power . Although many non-practicing Christians say they do not believe in God `` as described in the Bible , '' they do tend to believe in some other higher power or spiritual force in the universe . By contrast , most church-attending Christians say they believe in God as depicted in the Bible . And religiously unaffiliated adults generally say they do not believe in God or any higher power or spiritual force in the universe . Non-practicing Christians are also more likely than religiously unaffiliated adults to embrace spiritual concepts such as having a soul and feeling a connection to something that can not be measured .
By comparison , 26 % of whites , 29 % of Hispanics and 33 % of Asians say the legacy of slavery affects the position of black people in American society a great deal , though majorities in each group say it does so at least a fair amount . This year marked the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slave ship in Jamestown , Virginia .
Publics in the Middle East are divided when it comes to the degree of influence that Saudi Arabia wields in their country . A clear majority in Lebanon ( 83 % ) says that Saudi Arabia has a great deal or fair amount of influence on the direction of their country , but other publics in the region are not as convinced .
On a per capita basis , for example , the U.S. deficit with Germany stands out . In 2017 , Germany had a $ 777 per capita trade advantage with the U.S. , a figure calculated by dividing the U.S. deficit with Germany by Germany 's population . Mexico had a $ 575 per capita advantage with its northern neighbor . But China , with its huge population , came in at only a $ 270 per capita advantage .
When asked about how Trump makes important decisions , the public continues to say he is `` too impulsive . '' In April 2017 , shortly after he began his presidency , 63 % of the public said Trump was impulsive when making important decisions . Today , a similar share ( 61 % ) says this . A third of the public says Trump 's temperament is about right when making important decisions ; only 4 % say he is too cautious when making decisions . Two-thirds of Republicans ( 66 % ) say Trump is about right when making important decisions ; 31 % say he is too impulsive . A substantial majority of Democrats ( 86 % ) say Trump is too impulsive , while just 8 % say he is about right in making key decisions .
Among Clinton supporters , about one-in-five ( 19 % ) said life is worse , compared with nearly six-in-ten ( 59 % ) who said it is better . Meanwhile , Trump supporters were considerably more likely than Clinton voters ( 68 % versus 30 % ) to say that the future of the next generation of Americans will be worse compared with life today .
While both scientists and the public tend to see U.S. scientific achievements as high among other industrial countries , both groups are markedly more critical of the quality of American science , technology , engineering and math ( STEM ) education in grades K-12 . Only 16 % of AAAS scientists and 29 % of the general public rank U.S . STEM education for grades K-12 as above average or the best in the world . Fully 46 % of scientists and 29 % of the public rank K-12 STEM as below average .
While China 's global image is largely positive , the same is not true of its leader , President Xi Jinping . A global median of 53 % say they have little or no confidence in him to do the right thing in world affairs , compared with 28 % who do have confidence in Xi .
Saudi Arabia has a young and rapidly growing Muslim population . The kingdom has more than 30 million inhabitants , and roughly 93 % of them are Muslim , according to Pew Research Center data . The country is officially a Muslim nation and most Saudi Muslims are Sunni . However , a Shia minority accounts for an estimated 10 % to 15 % of the population . Additionally , Saudi Arabia is a young country : In 2015 , about 56 % of the kingdom 's Muslims were under the age of 30 . The number of Muslims in Saudi Arabia is projected to increase 51 % between 2015 and 2050 , though their share of the global Muslim population is expected to remain small at about 2 % .
As fact-checking organizations are increasingly being tapped to fight against misinformation , Republicans appear to have serious concerns about the fairness of these groups . Democrats , on the other hand , mostly think they are fair to all sides . Overall , Americans are split in their views of fact-checkers : Half say fact-checking efforts by news outlets and other organizations tend to deal fairly with all sides , while about the same portion ( 48 % ) say they tend to favor one side , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Feb. 19 to March 4 , 2019 . But members of the two parties do not see eye-to-eye on this question . Seven-in-ten Republicans say fact-checkers tend to favor one side , compared with roughly three-in-ten Democrats ( 29 % ) – a 41 percentage point difference . Conversely , most Democrats ( 69 % ) say fact-checkers deal fairly with all sides , a view shared by just 28 % of Republicans . Independents are more split , with 47 % saying fact-checkers tend to favor one side and 51 % saying they deal fairly with all sides – though independents who lean toward the Democratic Party and those who lean toward the Republican Party diverge sharply ( 65 % vs. 37 % say fact-checkers deal fairly with all sides , respectively ) .
Gender differences are also seen within each party . Republican men stand out for valuing people being able to speak their minds freely online over people being able to feel welcome and safe online . These Republican men ( 63 % ) are more likely than Republican women ( 44 % ) and both Democratic men ( 44 % ) and women ( 34 % ) to back that idea . Similarly , 76 % of Republican men say many people take offensive content they see online too seriously , compared with 67 % of Republican women who say the same . While the shares of Democrats who support this view are much smaller , Democratic men are more likely to voice the view that offensive content online is taken too seriously compared with Democratic women ( 43 % vs. 36 % ) . These gender differences on the issue of whether people take offensive content they see online too seriously are largely due to the differences between conservative Republican men and women ( 80 % vs. 68 % ) and liberal Democratic men and women ( 36 % vs. 27 % ) ; their more moderate counterparts differed little by gender .
When asked in an open-ended question what Latinx means in their own words , 42 % of those who have heard the term describe it as a gender-neutral one . As one 21-year-old woman said , `` Latinx is a more inclusive term to use for those who do not choose to identify with a certain gender . The terms Latino and Latina are very limiting for certain people . '' Other responses from the open-ended question offer other descriptions of Latinx and reactions to it . For example , 12 % of respondents who had heard of Latinx express disagreement or dislike of the term . Some described the term as an `` anglicism '' of the Spanish language , while others say the term is `` not representative of the larger Latino community . '' Among other responses , 12 % say Latinx is a term about being Hispanic or Latino , while 9 % of those aware of Latinx say it is an LGBTQ community inclusive term . And 6 % of respondents who have heard of Latinx say it is a new , alternative or replacement term for Latino .
When asked about the possibility of influencing the internal affairs of other countries , Russians are divided on their own government 's actions . Nearly equal numbers say the Russian government mostly stays out of the internal affairs of other countries ( 46 % ) as say it does try to influence other nations ( 45 % ) . Young Russians ( ages 18 to 29 ) are more likely to say Russia tries to interfere abroad ( 56 % ) than those 50 and older ( 41 % ) . Those Russians who lack confidence in Putin are also more willing to say Russia tries to influence other countries ( 63 % ) . However , Russians clearly see the U.S. as an interfering power , with 85 % saying the U.S. tries to shape the internal affairs of other countries versus only 9 % who say the U.S. stays out . In looking at other countries , roughly six-in-ten in Russia say that Canada ( 62 % ) and China ( 61 % ) avoid meddling , but 48 % say that Germany does try to influence the affairs of other countries .
Users know that there is a considerable amount of personal information about them available online . Among the list of items queried , photos were the most commonly reported content posted online ; 66 % of internet users reported that an image of them was available online . And half ( 50 % ) say that their birth date is available .
Economic opportunity is one of the primary drivers for moving to the U.S. mainland , according to Census Bureau data . Among island-born Puerto Ricans who moved to the mainland , 40 % said they left mainly for job-related reasons , while 39 % cited family-related reasons .
Terrorism and global threats : Defending against terrorism continues to rank among the public 's leading priorities for the president and Congress , with nearly three-quarters ( 73 % ) saying it is a top priority .
Overall , there has been little change since January in opinions about two other gun policy proposals : creating a federal database to track all gun sales and a ban on assault style weapons . Currently 66 % support a federal gun database and 54 % support an assault weapons ban .
Fourteen percent ( 14 % ) of internet users – or 11 % of all American adults – read a blog dealing with community issues in the twelve months preceding our survey , making community blogs as common as email communications as a way to keep up with neighborhood events . In contrast to face-to-face , telephone and email interactions , neighborhood blogs are relatively popular with young adults : 16 % of online 18 - 29 year olds read a blog dealing with community issues , similar to the rate for those ages 30 - 64 ( 15 % ) and significantly higher than internet users 65 and older ( 9 % of whom have done so ) . Community blogs are particularly popular among residents of urban areas , as 17 % of wired urbanites read a blog dealing with community issues . This is significantly higher than the 11 % online rural residents who read such blogs . Online whites ( 14 % ) , blacks ( 18 % ) and Hispanics ( 13 % ) are equally likely to read community blogs , and there is relatively little variation on this question based on income and education .
Irish voters recently approved a measure that modifies the country 's constitution and opens the door to legal abortion in a broader array of circumstances – perhaps more in line with the rest of Western Europe . The vote ( with 66 % approving the referendum ) underscores the findings in a new Pew Research Center report , which shows that people in Ireland – like those in 14 other Western European countries – believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases .
The views of police and the public also differ sharply on whether the country has made the changes needed to give blacks equal rights with whites . A lopsided majority of officers ( 80 % ) say the country has made the necessary changes . But the public is more divided : 48 % say the needed changes have been made while 50 % believe that more changes are needed to assure equal rights for black Americans . Underlying the police views on this question is a substantial difference between black and white police officers – a difference that is , in fact , larger than the gap between the public and police . About nine-in-ten white officers ( 92 % ) but only 29 % of black officers say the needed changes have already been made ( though black officers are about twice as likely as blacks overall to hold this view ) .
Moreover , social media has become a place where some users discuss relationships and investigate old ones . Roughly half of social media users ( 53 % ) say they have used these platforms to check up on someone they used to date or be in a relationship with , while 28 % say they have used social media to share or discuss things about their relationship or dating life . For adult users under the age of 30 , those shares who have used social media to checked-up on a former partner ( 70 % ) or posted about their own love life ( 48 % ) are even higher .
Recent survey data from the Pew Research Center suggest that there is a sharp divide between younger and older blacks on the issue of police searches . Older blacks ( those ages 60 and older ) are evenly split when it comes to what tactics the police should use in pursuing crime suspects . Some 46 % say the police should be allowed to stop and search anyone who fits the general description of a crime suspect , while roughly the same share ( 50 % ) say the police should not be able to search people just because they think they look suspicious .
The movement of minority students into suburban school districts since 1993 - 94 has had an impact on national trends in minority student isolation . Nationally , the typical black student in 2006 - 07 attended a school that was 52 % black , down from 54 % black in 1993 - 94 . This modest decline is partly attributable to the fact that a greater share of black students are now educated in suburban schools , where they tend to be less isolated than in city schools . Nationally , the typical Hispanic student in 2006 - 07 attended a school that was 55 % Hispanic , up from 52 % Hispanic in 1993 - 94 . The increase in Hispanic isolation nationally would have been even greater in the absence of the shift of Hispanic students out of city school districts and into suburban areas . Nationally , the typical Asian student in 2006 - 07 attended a school that was 23 % Asian , up from 22 % in 1993 - 94 .
While it 's hard to say whose account is the most accurate when it comes to how parenting and household responsibilities are shared , an analysis of the American Time Use Survey ( ATUS ) data provides a glimpse into how full-time working moms and dads spend their time . This analysis shows that while full-time working moms spend more time than full-time working dads on parenting and household tasks , the difference is modest . For example , mothers who work full time spend an average of 11.9 hours per week , or 1.7 hours per day , on housework , compared with 1.2 hours per day among fathers who work full time .
Most Americans favor granting permanent legal status to immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children . And a 56 % majority opposes substantially expanding the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border . Nearly three-quarters ( 73 % ) of Americans favor granting permanent legal status to immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally when they were children , while just 20 % are opposed , according to a new national survey by Pew Research Center , conducted June 5 - 12 among 2,002 adults . Opinions on this issue – and views of expanding the U.S.-Mexico border wall – have changed little since January . Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents overwhelmingly favor granting legal status to those who came to the U.S. illegally as children ( 89 % ) , as do about half of Republicans and Republican leaners ( 54 % ) ; about a third of Republicans ( 36 % ) oppose this policy . ( The findings in this survey do not relate to the current controversy over separating immigrants from their children at the border , but only to children who had already arrived in the U.S. with their families . )
Biden gets his most positive rating for his temperament : 60 % of registered voters describe him as even-tempered , more than twice the share who describe Trump this way . Moreover , a 54 % majority describes Biden as caring about the needs of ordinary people ; only 41 % say this phrase describes Trump very or somewhat well . And more voters say Biden is a good role model and describe him as honest than say that about Trump , by 15 percentage points and 12 points , respectively . Yet Biden has a notable weakness . Just 40 % of voters describe him as energetic – his lowest rating among the six traits included on the survey . This is Trump 's most positive attribute in the eyes of voters , with a 56 % majority describing him as energetic . There is only one trait of the six on which voters have similar views of the candidates ; 46 % say Trump is courageous while 45 % describe Biden this way , although more say this description applies to Trump very well ( 28 % vs. 15 % for Biden ) .
`` Interestingly , when we examine the individual states ' trends in per capita corruption convictions , we find the trends tend to be increasing both before and after casinos are legalized and begin operating , '' they report in the latest issue of the journal Applied Economics .
But black adults were much more likely than whites and somewhat more likely than Hispanic adults to frequently discuss the COVID-19 outbreak with other people . Roughly a quarter ( 26 % ) of black adults said they discuss it almost all the time , more than twice the 10 % of white adults who said the same , and more than the 19 % of Hispanic adults who said the same .
When asked to choose between having a close relationship to Germany or Russia , Americans clearly favor Germany ( 61 % to 26 % ) . When Germans are asked to choose between Russia and the U.S. , however , the gap is smaller ( 39 % to 25 % ) , and three-in-ten Germans volunteer both . But as it relates to a rising China , attitudes diverge the other way . Germans are about twice as likely to say they prefer a close relationship to the U.S. over China ( 50 % to 24 % ) , while Americans are almost equally divided ( 41 % prefer Germany , 44 % say China ) .
Large majorities favored the federal government providing free medical care for those unable to pay ( 76 % ) , helping state and local governments cover the costs of medical care for mothers at childbirth ( 74 % ) , spending $ 25 million ( big bucks in those days ) to control venereal diseases ( 68 % ) , and giving loans on `` a long time and easy basis '' to enable tenant farmers to buy the farms they then rented ( 73 % ) .
When asked about the appropriate role of government in regulating major technology companies , around half of U.S. adults ( 51 % ) believe these companies should be regulated more than they are now . Around one-in-ten ( 9 % ) feel they should be regulated less than they are now , while 38 % say their current level of regulation is appropriate . Although Republicans are more likely than Democrats to see an anti-conservative bias among major technology companies , this attitude does not translate into a broader desire by Republicans for increased regulation of these companies . Just over half ( 57 % ) of Democrats and Democratic leaners think major technology companies should be regulated more heavily than they are now , but that share falls to 44 % among Republicans and Republican leaners . Indeed , 12 % of Republicans say these companies should be regulated less than they are currently . That view is shared by 7 % of Democrats .
In the Senate , lawmakers spend an average 317 calendar days in session during a two-year congressional term , according to the Center 's analysis .
While populist attitudes span the ideological spectrum , populist political parties are relatively unpopular in Western Europe . Across the surveyed countries , around four-in-ten adults or fewer have a favorable view of the populist party ( or parties ) in their nation . For example , only 34 % of people in Denmark have a favorable view of the Danish People 's Party ; 23 % of people in the UK view the UK Independence Party favorably ; and 16 % of French adults see the National Front favorably . Traditional parties do much better than populist parties in Denmark , Germany , the Netherlands and Sweden . But they face difficulties elsewhere : For most of the traditional parties the survey asked about , three-in-ten or fewer of respondents in France , Italy and Spain have a favorable view . In all eight surveyed countries , attitudes about both types of parties – traditional and populist – are heavily colored by respondents ' ideological views .
Whatever one 's feelings about the health care-reform measure , more Americans are covered by some form of health insurance now – whether employer-provided , purchased on an exchange or obtained via Medicaid or Medicare – than when Obama took office . According to the Census Bureau , 16.1 % of Americans ( nearly 49 million ) were uninsured in 2009 ; by 2014 , the last year for which there are data , only 10.4 % ( almost 33 million ) Americans lacked health coverage .
Non-internet users as a group are disproportionately old and poor . The median age of non-internet users is 59 , and 25 % report having household incomes under $ 20,000 per year . It is not , however , simply a question of money or age . Non-internet users do not have very positive attitudes about information technology . Many report worries about information overload and few link information technology to greater control over their lives . Moreover , non-internet users are apt to see the online environment as a dangerous place – that is , a place with inappropriate or irrelevant content . Given that these non-users are people with worries about information technology and not a lot of extra disposable income , luring them online wo n't be an easy task .
The two publics have moved in opposite directions regarding defense spending , which has been a contentious issue in relations between the U.S. and its NATO allies . The share of Americans who say their European allies should increase their defense spending dropped by 6 percentage points between 2017 and 2018 , while the share saying European allies should keep their spending about the same rose 9 points . Germans , on the other hand , saw an 11-point increase in the share saying they wanted their own country to spend more on national defense .
If demography is destiny , then Christianity 's future lies in Africa . By 2060 , a plurality of Christians – more than four-in-ten – will call sub-Saharan Africa home , up from 26 % in 2015 , according to a new analysis of demographic data by Pew Research Center . At the same time , the share of Christians living in many other regions – notably Europe – is projected to decline .
In the survey , conducted in France and 14 other Western European countries , the Center asked whether people agreed or disagreed with two strongly worded negative statements : `` Jews always pursue their own interests and not the interest of the country they live in , '' and `` Jews always overstate how much they have suffered . '' Roughly seven-in-ten or more French respondents either completely or mostly disagreed with these statements , while about one-in-five completely or mostly agreed with them .
Across 33 nations surveyed in 2019 , a median of 55 % disapproved of the U.S. allowing fewer immigrants into the country ; just 34 % approved . A median of six-in-ten opposed building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border . And majorities opposed Trump 's efforts to erect trade barriers in addition to physical barriers , with a median of nearly seven-in-ten ( 68 % ) disapproving of increased U.S. tariffs or fees on imported goods .
When asked about societal priorities around family , voters are somewhat less likely to say that society is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority than they were four years ago ( 36 % today , 42 % in 2016 ) . As was the case in 2016 , a slim majority of Trump 's voters this year say this ( 55 % today , 57 % in 2016 ) . But Biden voters are slightly more likely today to say that society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children than Clinton voters were in 2016 ( 77 % today , 69 % in 2016 ) .
Cell phone ownership has remained stable over the last year , but users are taking advantage of a much wider range of their phones ' capabilities compared with a similar point in 2009 . Of the eight mobile data applications we asked about in both 2009 and 2010 , all showed statistically significant year-to-year growth .
Scientists overwhelmingly agree that humans evolved over time , and most Americans are aware that this is the case . Among scientists connected to the American Association for the Advancement of Science , 98 % say they believe humans evolved over time . Roughly three-quarters ( 76 % ) of Americans perceive that most biological scientists hold this view , according to the new study . Those in the general public who reject evolution are divided on whether there is a scientific consensus on the topic : 46 % say most biological scientists think humans have evolved due to processes such as natural selection , and 52 % say most biological scientists think humans have always existed in their present form .
Dissatisfaction is apparent even in some of the most established democracies . More than half of those surveyed in the UK ( 69 % ) , the U.S. ( 59 % ) , France ( 58 % ) and Japan ( 53 % ) express dissatisfaction with how democracy is working in their country . In Greece , 74 % are dissatisfied , the highest share of all countries surveyed . People in Asia-Pacific countries are most satisfied : A median of 58 % in the region express satisfaction with how democracy is working in their country .
Black households have only 10 cents in wealth for every dollar held by white households . In 2016 , the median wealth of non-Hispanic white households was $ 171,000 . That 's 10 times the wealth of black households ( $ 17,100 ) – a larger gap than in 2007 . The Great Recession of 2007 - 2009 triggered a stark decline in wealth for U.S. families and further widened the already large wealth gap between white and black households . Yet the black-to-white wealth gap has evolved differently for families at different income levels , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Federal Reserve data . The wealth gap increased between middle-income black and white families , but shrank between lower-income black and white families from 2007 to 2016 . Much of the reduction in the wealth gap among lower-income families was driven by a sharp decrease in wealth for whites .
Another aspect of campaigns that is frowned upon by voters is the use of personal insults by candidates . In a race that has been punctuated by harsh personal attacks , 68 % of voters say that `` personally insulting political opponents is never fair game . '' Just 30 % say personal attacks are sometimes fair game . Majorities of both Republican ( 60 % ) and Democratic voters ( 74 % ) say that personally insulting political opponents is never fair game . Majorities of supporters of most candidates say that personal insults are `` never fair game '' but supporters of Trump are divided , with nearly half saying personal insults are sometimes fair game . Nearly as many Republican voters supporting Trump say personally insulting an opponent is sometimes fair game ( 47 % ) as say such insults are never fair game ( 51 % ) . Among Republican supporters of Cruz and Kasich , nearly two-thirds or more say personal insults are never fair game . Fully three-quarters of Democratic voters supporting Clinton ( 74 % ) or supporting Sanders ( 74 % ) say that personally insulting political opponents is never acceptable .
NASA continues to be very popular among the public , with four times as many Americans holding a favorable view of the space agency as unfavorable ( 68 % vs. 17 % ) . In contrast with many other departments and agencies of the federal government , Republicans and Democrats generally have the same positive view . Highly educated Americans have an especially positive view of NASA . Nearly eight-in-ten ( 78 % ) of those with a graduate degree view the agency favorably , while just 11 % view it unfavorably . Among those with no more than a high school education , 61 % have a favorable impression of NASA and 21 % view the agency unfavorably . Majorities of independents ( 70 % ) , Democrats ( 68 % ) and Republicans ( 63 % ) have favorable opinions of NASA .
Most across the Middle East and in the U.S. lack confidence in Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed to do the right thing regarding world affairs . Among those in the five countries where the question was asked , Israelis have the least faith in the prince , with roughly eight-in-ten saying they doubt his ability to effectively manage international dealings . Only about a fifth of American and Lebanese respondents express confidence that the crown prince can effectively handle international concerns .
The exercise of military force has been controversial in Japan since World War II . The Japanese Constitution outlaws war as a means for the state to settle international disputes . A majority ( 62 % ) of Japanese say Japan should limit its military role in the Asia-Pacific region . Just 29 % voice the view that Japan should play a more active military role in regional affairs . Notably , support for a more active military role is up 6 percentage points since 2015 . Among the minority of Japanese who believe Japan should take on more military responsibilities , men ( 36 % ) are more likely than women ( 22 % ) to hold this view .
Roughly six-in-ten men who have online dated in the past five years ( 57 % ) say they feel as if they did not get enough messages , while just 24 % of women say the same . Meanwhile , women who have online dated in this time period are five times as likely as men to think they were sent too many messages ( 30 % vs. 6 % ) .
As previous Pew Research Center surveys have found , voters have very negative feelings about the presidential campaign . Far more say they have been feeling frustrated ( 57 % ) , disgusted ( 55 % ) or scared ( 43 % ) than say they are interested ( 31 % ) , optimistic ( 15 % ) or excited ( just 10 % ) . Yet only 9 % of voters say they feel indifferent about the campaign . Trump and Clinton supporters express similar levels of frustration ( 55 % and 53 % , respectively ) and differ little in their feelings of disgust ( 53 % vs. 48 % ) or fear ( 46 % vs. 41 % ) . Negative feelings about the campaign rose over the summer . The share of voters saying they 've been feeling frustrated has risen 8 percentage points since earlier in the summer ( from 49 % to 57 % ) . Similarly , a larger share now say they are disgusted ( 45 % then , 55 % now ) , while slightly more now say they are scared than said this two months ago ( 37 % then , 43 % now ) . There has been little change in the share expressing positive feelings about the campaign over the course of the summer .
Across the 14 countries surveyed , a median of 78 % say they have no confidence in Chinese President Xi to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs , with at least seven-in-ten in every country saying they lack confidence in Xi . Only a median of 19 % express any trust .
The national survey by the Pew Research Center , conducted Jan. 9 - 12 among 1,006 adults , finds that just 18 % paid very close attention to Christie 's apology on Jan. 9 for the highway lane closures ordered by his aides . By contrast , 44 % very closely followed news about the cold winter weather that gripped much of the U.S. and 28 % tracked news about the economy . The release of a book by former Defense Secretary Robert Gates that criticized the Obama administration drew even less interest than news about Christie . Just 11 % followed news about Gates ' book very closely .
In this survey , Americans were asked specifically about how they would respond to outreach by public health officials trying to contact them to speak about the coronavirus outbreak . Half of respondents were asked how likely they would be to speak with a public health official on the phone or via text message about the coronavirus outbreak , and the remainder were asked how they would respond to a public health official who showed up at their residence . About four-in-ten Americans ( 41 % ) who were asked about their likelihood of speaking with a public health official if they contacted them by phone or text message say that they would be not at all or not too likely to do this , and 40 % of those asked about speaking with an official who showed up at their residence say they would be not at all or not too likely to do the same . There are also differences in people 's reported likelihood of speaking with a public health official by income and education . For instance , 30 % of Americans with a bachelor 's degree or higher say they would be not at all or not too likely to speak by phone or text message , compared with 44 % of those with some college and 48 % of those with a high school diploma or less ; and 35 % of those with at least a bachelor 's degree say they would be not at all or not too likely to speak in person , compared with 42 % each of those with a high school diploma or less or some college . A similar pattern applies by income . Those with relatively low and middle incomes are less likely to say they 'd be likely to speak with a public health official about the coronavirus outbreak compared with those from households with the highest incomes .
Americans have grown slightly more positive about the WHO 's handling of the pandemic . Only 53 % of Americans said this summer that the organization had handled the outbreak well , but that represented an increase since the spring , when only 46 % said this .
In a 2015 study that used a broader definition of the term – one that took into account how adults described their own race as well as the racial background of their parents and grandparents – Pew Research Center estimated that 6.9 % of the U.S. adult population could be considered multiracial . The 2015 study also explored the attitudes and experiences of these adults , revealing the complexities of multiracial identity . Here are five key findings from that report : Racial identity can change over the course of one 's life . While 69 % of Americans who reported more than one race for themselves in the 2015 survey said they always thought of themselves as two or more races , about three-in-ten ( 29 % ) said there was a time when they thought of themselves as only one race . Similarly , among adults who selected only one race for themselves but had a multiracial family background , 29 % said they once thought of themselves as being two or more races .
It remains to be seen whether the strengthened faith that some Americans are experiencing will translate into greater service attendance , since most houses of worship are closed due to nationwide social distancing recommendations . Indeed , among U.S. adults who say they typically attend religious services at least once or twice a month , just 3 % say their congregation is still holding in-person services . The vast majority ( 91 % ) say their congregation has closed its religious services to the public , and 5 % say they do not know what their congregation has done . Vast majorities of churchgoing Christians , those who attend worship services at least once a month , report that their congregation has been closed , including nine-in-ten or more among evangelical Protestants ( 92 % ) , Catholics ( 94 % ) and mainline Protestants ( 96 % ) . A somewhat smaller majority of those in the historically black Protestant tradition say their church has closed due to the outbreak ( 79 % ) .
Attention to the presidential election at this point in the cycle is also at a historic high in Pew Research Center surveys dating back more than three decades . Today , 63 % of all U.S. adults say they have been following news about candidates for the 2020 presidential election very or fairly closely . This is 9 points higher than in August of 2015 , and 10 or more points higher than similar points for all elections dating back to when this question was first asked in 1987 .
The public gives the `` typical American '' a mixed assessment when asked about specific traits . Most ( 79 % ) agree that the term `` patriotic '' describes the typical American very or fairly well , and majorities also view the typical American as `` honest '' ( 69 % ) and `` intelligent '' ( 67 % ) .
When it comes to the impact their DNA test results have had on how they view themselves , 15 % of mail-in test users say their results changed the way they think about their racial or ethnic identity . Nonwhites are twice as likely as whites to say this ( 24 % vs. 12 % ) .
• Newsroom salaries fell in 2012 . Overall , television news salaries fell about 2 % , the same percentage they gained in 2011 . News writers and news assistants enjoyed the biggest gains—16 % and 13 % respectively—from 2011 . Top news managers lost ground . News directors ' salaries were down 2.3 % , assistant news directors ' salaries were down 6.7 % and executive producers ' dropped 9.1 % . Salaries of news and sports anchors remained the same .
Most teens report attending religious services with either both ( 40 % ) or one ( 25 % ) of their parents . Another 7 % say they generally attend with other people , such as grandparents , other family members or friends . Just 1 % say they attend worship services alone . Roughly one-quarter say they never attend religious services or declined to answer the question .
Overall , the percentage of the public that is looking forward to this fall 's midterm election is about the same today ( 51 % ) as it was in January 2010 ( 50 % ) . Currently , 63 % of Republicans and 53 % of Democrats say they are anticipating the midterm elections ; a similar gap was evident four years ago ( 60 % of Republicans vs. 48 % of Democrats ) .
Younger adults are far more likely than their elders to often get news on a mobile device . About seven-in-ten ( 72 % ) adults ages 18 to 29 often get news this way , compared with 38 % among those ages 65 and older . Conversely , those 65 and older are more likely to often get news on a desktop or laptop computer than those ages 18 to 29 ( 34 % vs. 23 % ) . Race and partisanship also play a role in mobile news use . For example , about six-in-ten Hispanic adults ( 63 % ) often get news through a mobile device , compared with 54 % of whites . The opposite is true when it comes to getting news on desktop or laptop computers ( 23 % among Hispanic adults vs. 31 % of whites ) . Black adults fall between Hispanic and white adults on this question . Meanwhile , roughly six-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents ( 62 % ) often get news on a mobile device , compared with 53 % of Republicans and Republican leaners . When it comes to desktop news use , there are no major differences between Democrats and Republicans . Those with more formal education and higher incomes are more likely to get news on both mobile and desktop or laptop computers . U.S. adults with a college degree , for instance , are more likely to often get news on mobile than those with a high school education or less ( 65 % vs. 49 % ) .
Other major stories of the week included the 2008 presidential campaign , mounting tensions between the U.S. and Iran , the exposé on conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , and the rescue of the Mt . Hood climbers . Public interest in the campaign edged up slightly from the previous week as did coverage – 22 % followed campaign news very closely and 12 % said this was their top story of the week . Campaign news made up 12 % of the newshole with a good deal of the coverage devoted to feuding between the Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama camps .
Despite the growth of internet news , it is clear that television news outlets , specifically cable news outlets , are central to people 's impressions of the news media . When asked what first comes to mind when they think of news organizations , 63 % volunteer the name of a cable news outlet , with CNN and Fox News by far the most prevalent in people 's minds . Only about a third ( 36 % ) name one of the broadcast networks . Fewer than one-in-five mention local news outlets and only 5 % mention a national newspaper such as the New York Times , Wall Street Journal or USA Today . Just 3 % name a website – either web-only or linked to a traditional news organization – when asked what comes to mind when they think of news organizations .
President Donald Trump has appointed 29 judges to the federal bench since his inauguration , including 14 appeals court judges and a Supreme Court justice , Neil Gorsuch . While Trump has moved quickly to put his stamp on the federal judiciary , his judges have also faced a record amount of opposition , at least based on the average number of Senate votes cast against them . The 23 men and six women Trump has successfully appointed so far have faced a total of 654 `` no '' votes on the floor of the Senate , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the Federal Judicial Center and the U.S. Senate . That works out to an average of nearly 23 votes against each confirmed judge – by far the highest average for any president 's judges since the Senate expanded to its current 100 members in 1959 . The 330 judges Barack Obama appointed during his eight years in office faced an average of six votes against them . George W. Bush 's 328 confirmed judges faced an average of two , and Bill Clinton 's 382 judges faced an average of just over one . ( This analysis counts judges for each Senate confirmation vote they faced . Some judges held multiple judicial positions and are counted more than once . Clarence Thomas , for instance , is counted twice under George H.W . Bush 's total because Thomas was confirmed to two separate positions that each required a confirmation vote : first to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990 , then to the Supreme Court in 1991 . )
A median of 25 % across the 10 European countries polled say France plays a more important role in the world . Views that France 's global position has remained the same are widespread . A plurality in eight of 10 countries say France plays as important a role as it did 10 years ago .
When asked about seven potential international threats , Canadians are clearly most concerned about the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS . Roughly six-in-ten Canadians ( 58 % ) say they are very concerned about ISIS . Canadians are also very worried about global climate change ( 45 % ) and Iran 's nuclear program ( 43 % ) . And 39 % are concerned about cyberattacks .3
Many Russians see inherent conflict in their relationship with the West , but few rule out cooperation . According to a recently released Pew Research Center report based on 2015 survey data , overwhelming majorities in Russia believe that their country serves as an important counterbalance to the West ( 85 % ) and that Russian values clash with Western values ( 73 % ) .
When asked about the information that advertisers can gather about their child 's online behavior , parents ' concern levels rival and sometimes even exceed worries about their child 's interaction with people they do not know online . In a 2012 survey 81 % of parents said they were `` very '' or `` somewhat '' concerned about how much information advertisers can learn about their child 's online behavior . By comparison , the combined levels of parental concern regarding their children 's interactions with people they do not know amounts to 72 % of all parents .
Over the past month , conservative Republicans have become more likely to say their greater concern is that restrictions will not be lifted quickly enough . The 61 % of conservative Republicans who now say this is up from 53 % in another survey conducted April 7 - 12 . Among moderate and liberal Republicans , by comparison , the 61 % who now say they are more concerned that restrictions will be lifted too quickly is nearly identical to the 60 % who said this in the earlier survey . Democrats are more united than Republicans when it comes to their concerns about state-level restrictions . About nine-in-ten liberal Democrats ( 91 % ) say their greater concern is that restrictions will be lifted too quickly , a view shared by more than eight-in-ten conservative or moderate Democrats ( 83 % ) .
Conversely , although about three-quarters of Biden voters say they are at least somewhat confident that all voters who are legally qualified and want to vote will be able to cast a ballot , nearly all ( 99 % ) say it is important that they be able to do so . Among Trump supporters , more than nine-in-ten say both that they are confident that all eligible voters will be able to cast ballots ( 93 % ) and that this is important ( 99 % ) .
The average audience for the evening newscasts for ABC , CBS and NBC remained relatively stable in 2018 , with 5.3 million viewers tuning in on average , compared with 5.2 million in 2017 , according to Comscore TV Essentials® data . ( Average audience is defined as the average number of TVs tuned to a program throughout a time period . )
The majority of chiefs of staff to date – 19 – previously worked in other White House roles , such as deputy chief of staff or adviser to the president , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of their biographical information . This group also includes three former White House budget directors : Leon Panetta , who served as chief of staff to Bill Clinton ; Joshua Bolten , chief of staff to George W. Bush ; and Jack Lew , who served under Barack Obama . ( Lew had served as budget director twice – once under Clinton and once under Obama – before becoming Obama 's chief . )
More than eight-in-ten Hispanics ( 86 % ) favor Congress passing a law granting permanent legal status to immigrants who came illegally to the U.S. as children . This comes as the U.S. Supreme Court evaluates the Trump administration 's decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) , a program that has protected about 800,000 unauthorized immigrants who came to the U.S. as children – most of them from Mexico . Hispanic Democrats ( 92 % ) and Republicans ( 77 % ) both broadly support Congress creating a path to legal status for immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children .
Automated accounts post a substantial share of links to a wide range of online media outlets on Twitter . As noted above , the Center 's analysis estimates that 66 % of tweeted links to popular news and current events websites are posted by bots . The analysis also finds that a relatively small number of automated accounts are responsible for a substantial share of the links to popular media outlets on Twitter . The 500 most-active suspected bot accounts alone were responsible for 22 % of all the links to these news and current events sites over the period in which this study was conducted . By contrast , the 500 most-active human accounts were responsible for just 6 % of all links to such sites .
Fully 63 % of Americans approve of the Obama administration 's decision last month to re-establish diplomatic ties with Cuba after more than 50 years . And there is equally broad support for going further and ending the decades-long U.S. trade embargo against Cuba ( 66 % favor this ) . The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center , conducted Jan. 7 - 11 among 1,504 adults , finds strong support among Democrats and independents for the restoration of diplomatic ties with Cuba , and for ending the embargo . About three-quarters of Democrats ( 74 % ) , along with 67 % of independents support the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries , with similar levels of support for ending the trade embargo , `` which would allow U.S. companies to do business in Cuba and Cuban companies to do business in the U.S . ''
In both countries , confidence in Trump and feelings toward the U.S. are related to the sentiment of words chosen . Those with no confidence in Trump are at least twice as likely as those who express confidence in him to use a negative word to describe the U.S. ( 60 % vs. 22 % in Canada , 33 % vs. 15 % in Mexico ) . The same goes for views of the U.S. : Those with an unfavorable view of the U.S. are at least twice as those with a favorable view to use a negative word to describe the U.S. ( 70 % vs. 30 % in Canada , 44 % vs. 13 % in Mexico ) .
Core Conservatives are more likely than other GOP-leaning groups to say they follow politics and government most of the time and say they always vote . Consequently , while Core Conservatives make up about a third of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents overall ( 31 % ) , they constitute a larger proportion of politically engaged Republicans ( 43 % ) .
The latest evidence for that comes from Minneapolis-based investment bank Piper Jaffray . Earlier this spring , the firm , which regularly surveys teens ' spending patterns , brand preferences , media and entertainment habits and other information of interest to investors , asked 4,800 teens nationwide whether they shopped online ; not surprisingly , more than three-quarters said they did . But when Piper asked teens whether they preferred shopping online or in stores , 78 % of girls and 75 % of boys said they 'd rather go to actual stores .
Among Democrats , concerns about catching and spreading the virus are relatively unchanged since April . About six-in-ten Democrats ( 64 % ) continue to say they are very or somewhat concerned that they will require hospitalization due to the virus , while about three-quarters ( 77 % ) are very or somewhat concerned about unknowingly spreading it . Today , clear majorities of black ( 63 % ) and Hispanic ( 73 % ) adults say they are very or somewhat concerned about getting COVID-19 and requiring hospitalization , which is little different than the shares saying this in April . By comparison , 43 % of white adults now say this ( down from 51 % in April ) . There is a similar pattern in levels of concern about unknowingly spreading the coronavirus . Today , 79 % of Hispanic adults and 72 % of black adults say they are at least somewhat concerned they might unknowingly spread the coronavirus , while 56 % of white adults say this . The share of white adults saying this has dropped since April , while concerns among blacks and Hispanics are as high or higher than they were two months ago .
President Donald Trump is generally seen more negatively than other major world leaders , with a median of 83 % expressing no confidence in him on world affairs .
Donald Trump 's job approval continues to remain more negative than positive . Currently , 39 % of the public approves of the way Trump is handling his job as president , while 55 % disapprove . Ratings of Trump are virtually unchanged from April ( 39 % approved ) and February ( also 39 % ) .
Among the 44 % of Republican and Republican-leaning voters who have heard of Cain , 39 % say there is a good chance they would vote for him , while 35 % say there is some chance . Nearly twice as many Republican voters have heard of Romney ( 85 % ) . Among this group , 32 % say there is a good chance they would vote for him and 43 % say there is some chance .
The Taliban , which has a base of operations on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan , is seen unfavorably by 59 % of the population in Pakistan . Only 8 % have a favorable view of this extremist organization , with a third of Pakistanis not offering an opinion . Views of the Taliban have not changed substantially in recent years . Opinions toward specific branches of the Taliban , such as Tehrik-i-Taliban and the Afghan Taliban , are also negative . In a spring 2013 survey , both those groups received low ratings ( 56 % unfavorable and 47 % unfavorable , respectively ) .
Americans ages 60 and older are alone for more than half of their daily measured time – which includes all waking hours except those spent engaged in personal activities such as grooming . All told , this amounts to about seven hours a day ; and among those who live by themselves , alone time rises to over 10 hours a day , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data .
As online college courses have become increasingly prevalent , the general public and college presidents offer different assessments of their educational value . Just three-in-ten American adults ( 29 % ) say a course taken online provides an equal educational value to one taken in a classroom , according to a March 2011 survey . By contrast , fully half of college presidents ( 51 % ) say online courses provide the same value .
The Obama administration deported a record 438,421 unauthorized immigrants in fiscal year 2013 , continuing a streak of stepped up enforcement that has resulted in more than 2 million deportations since Obama took office , newly released Department of Homeland Security data show .
In general terms , most Americans think U.S. democracy is working at least somewhat well . Yet a 61 % majority says `` significant changes '' are needed in the fundamental `` design and structure '' of American government to make it work in current times . When asked to compare the U.S. political system with those of other developed nations , fewer than half rate it `` above average '' or `` best in the world . ''
Public attitudes about the economy have turned bleak in much of the world as the coronavirus outbreak continues to affect daily life , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted this summer in 14 nations in Europe , North America and the Asia-Pacific region . Assessments of national economies have seen swift downturns in many countries , and few see improvements anytime soon amid what the International Monetary Fund calls a `` crisis like no other . '' Overall , a median of only 31 % of adults across the surveyed nations assess their country 's current economic situation as good , while 68 % say conditions are bad . In Europe , attitudes are mixed . Generally , Northern Europeans surveyed have more positive assessments , with a majority of Danes , Swedes and Dutch rating their country 's economic condition positively . Germans are split ( 51 % good , 47 % bad ) . In the rest of the European countries surveyed – Belgium , the UK , France , Spain and Italy – large majorities rate economic conditions negatively .
And who 's responsible for the difficulties of the middle class ? While Congress gets the most votes , with 62 % assigning it `` a lot '' of the blame , the Pew Research report found plenty of blame to go around . The one exception : Middle-class people themselves , with just 8 % assigning their own socioeconomic group `` a lot '' of blame , and 47 % saying they were n't to blame at all .
Most Westerners ( as well as Indians ) strongly disagree . Among those in the French general public who see Islamic identity on the rise , 87 % call it a bad thing ; in Germany , 83 % say so ; in Spain ( 82 % ) ; in India , 78 % .
Many U.S. teens report having religious or spiritual experiences at least once or twice a month . Half feel a deep sense of spiritual peace and well-being at least monthly , while 46 % say they think about the meaning and purpose of life and 40 % report feeling a deep sense of wonder about the universe . The most common experience is a strong feeling of gratitude or thankfulness , reported by 77 % of teens in the survey .
Nearly seven-in-ten registered voters say postponing state primary elections has been a necessary step to address the coronavirus outbreak , according to a Pew Research Center survey . This includes about two-thirds of Republican voters ( 64 % ) and 71 % of Democratic voters .
One other question , not included as part of the scale , asked survey respondents which of two statements best describes the scientific method : That it produces findings meant to be continually tested and updated over time , or that it identifies unchanging core principles and truths . Two-thirds of Americans ( 67 % ) say the scientific method is designed to be iterative , producing findings that are continually tested and updated , while 15 % say the method produces unchanging core principles and truths , and 17 % say they are not sure .
More than a third of Americans ( 37 % ) say they heard a lot last week about a Rutgers University student who committed suicide after other students streamed live video of him having a sexual encounter in his dorm room over the internet . About a quarter ( 24 % ) say they heard a lot about a controversy concerning the immigration status of California Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman 's housekeeper . About as many ( 23 % ) say they heard a lot about a recall of Fisher Price toys and other products . Fewer had heard a lot about five soldiers charged with the murder of Afghan civilians ( 15 % ) or about a rally of liberal groups in Washington , D.C. , last weekend ( 10 % ) .
The laws seem to align with Russia 's rejection of homosexuality . About three-quarters ( 74 % ) of Russians said homosexuality should not be accepted by society , while just 16 % said it should be accepted , according to a recent Pew Research Center survey . Globally , homosexuality was most accepted in Spain ( 88 % ) , Germany ( 87 % ) , the Czech Republic ( 80 % ) and Canada ( 80 % ) . A smaller majority of people in the United States ( 60 % ) also thought it should be accepted .
Americans generally agree that immigrants – whether undocumented or living legally in the country – mostly do not work in jobs that U.S. citizens want , with a majority saying so across racial and ethnic groups and among both political parties . This is particularly true when it comes to undocumented immigrants . About three-quarters of adults ( 77 % ) say undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs U.S. citizens do not want , while 21 % say undocumented immigrants fill jobs U.S. citizens would like to have , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted April 29 to May 5 . Hispanics ( 88 % ) are most likely to say undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs U.S. citizens do not want , with more Hispanic immigrants than U.S.-born Hispanics saying so ( 94 % vs. 82 % ) . By comparison , similar shares of white ( 75 % ) and black ( 71 % ) adults say the same .
Fourth , the survey finds that the broader public has decidedly mixed views about jobs in the emerging gig economy . On one hand , a majority of Americans feel that these jobs are good options for people who want a flexible work schedule ( 68 % ) or for older adults who do n't want to work full time any more ( 54 % ) . On the other hand , around one-in-five feel that these jobs place too much financial burden on workers ( 21 % ) and let companies take advantage of workers ( 23 % ) , while just 16 % feel that this type of work offers jobs that people can build careers out of .
But more generally , Americans are somewhat skeptical about the value of a college degree in the job market : Only 16 % of all U.S. adults – including 13 % of those with at least a four-year college degree – say that a bachelor 's degree prepares students `` very well '' for a well-paying job in today 's economy , while an additional 51 % say it prepares students somewhat well . And 12 % say a two-year associate degree prepares students very well ( with 46 % saying it prepares them somewhat well ) . About a quarter of Americans ( 26 % ) say that certification programs in a professional , technical or vocational field prepares students very well ( 52 % say somewhat well ) .
Regional growth patterns have changed some following the start of the Great Recession . While counties in the South continued to account for the largest share of the nation 's Hispanic population growth ( 43 % between 2007 and 2014 , a small decline from 44 % between 2000 and 2007 ) , counties in the Northeast – particularly those in New Jersey , New York and Pennsylvania – accounted for a larger share of national Hispanic population growth since 2007 than in 2000 - 2007 ( 14 % vs. 11 % , respectively ) . 2 There was a small decline for all of the other regions of the U.S. during these periods .
A new Pew Research Center survey finds that 27 % of U.S. adults believe Trump 's election reflects God 's will in the sense that the 2016 outcome must be part of God 's overall plan , but that this does n't necessarily mean God approves of Trump 's policies . Far fewer U.S. adults – just 5 % – say God chose Trump because God approves of his policies . About half of Americans say God does n't get involved in U.S. presidential elections ( 49 % ) , while the remainder say they do n't believe in God ( 16 % ) .
But Americans and Japanese differ on Japan 's role in regional security . Seven decades after the end of World War II , the American public is divided over whether Japan should play a more active military role in helping to maintain peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region : 47 % would like to see Tokyo take a more active role and 43 % would prefer that Japan limit its role . Americans who trust Japan also say they want Tokyo to play a greater strategic role in the region . And Americans who do not trust China say they want Japan to take on more of the military burden in Asia .
With less than two weeks before the midterm elections , the Republican Party holds significant leads on several major issues . Voters say the GOP could do a better job than the Democrats on the economy , and the Republicans hold double-digit advantages on both terrorism and the budget deficit .
News reports last week about the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas competed for public attention with stories about the U.S. financial crisis and the Obama presidential transition . Roughly three-in-ten ( 28 % ) paid very close attention to news about renewed fighting in the Gaza Strip , while 18 % say this was the single news story they followed most closely . Still , in a week in which the media devoted more newshole to Middle East coverage than any other story , Americans remained most focused on the continuing economic crisis . Public interest in the first days of the latest Middle East conflict is on par with other recent foreign news stories , but is lower than interest in the Israel-Hezbollah war in August 2006 : 40 % followed news of that conflict very closely . It is important to note that the current survey was already in the field when Israel launched its ground invasion on Jan. 3 , ratcheting up the intensity of the conflict and the media coverage . According to the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism , reports from the Middle East led all news coverage last week , accounting for 21 % of the newshole . [ For a ranking of recent foreign news stories See `` Strong Advance Interest in Democratic Convention '' released August 21 , 2008 . ]
Among eight international concerns tested , the topmost on the minds of Filipinos is the threat of the Islamic militant group known as ISIS , whose affiliates operate in the southern parts of the island nation . Seven-in-ten say ISIS poses a major threat to the country . Filipinos are also worried about global climate change ( 65 % major threat ) and cyberattacks from other countries ( 64 % ) . Young people ages 18 to 29 are much more concerned about climate change ( 77 % ) and cyberattacks ( 71 % ) than are those ages 50 and older ( 58 % and 51 % respectively ) . About half of Filipinos are also worried about China 's power and influence , almost double the proportion who say Russia ( 26 % ) or the U.S. ( 25 % ) are a major threat .
About a third of 18- to 29-year-olds ( 35 % ) say the pandemic has been made a bigger deal than it really is , close to the overall average . But those youngest adults are more likely to say it has been made a smaller deal ( 32 % ) than any other age group . At the same time , fewer 18- to 29-year-olds say the outbreak has been approached about right ( 32 % ) than any other age group .
Opposition to Iran developing nuclear weapons is nearly unanimous in Germany , Japan , France , and Great Britain , as well as in the U.S. Opinion in predominantly Muslim countries varies widely : solid majorities in Turkey ( 61 % ) and Indonesia ( 59 % ) oppose Iran acquiring nuclear weapons , but people in Egypt and Jordan are divided , and most Pakistanis ( 52 % ) favor Iran acquiring nuclear weapons . In addition , more people in major industrialized nations than in Muslim countries believe that Iran wants a nuclear program to develop weapons , not nuclear energy .
While public trust in scientists and their work can be mixed , a strong majority of the American public thinks of science as having a positive effect on society , and most expect continued benefits to accrue from science in the years ahead . About seven-in-ten U.S. adults ( 73 % ) say science has had a positive effect on society , just 3 % say it has had a negative effect and 23 % say it has yielded an equal mix of positive and negative effects , according to a Pew Research Center survey . White adults are more likely than black and Hispanic adults to see the effects of science in positive terms . And people who have higher levels of factual knowledge about science , based on an 11-item index , are especially likely to think science has had a positive effect overall .
In addition , nearly half of AAAS scientists – 47 % – use social media to talk about science or read about scientific developments at least some of the time . Some 24 % of these AAAS scientists blog about science and research .
Since the Pew Research Center began consistently measuring internet penetration , educational attainment has been one of the strongest indicators of use . While a large majority of the well-educated has consistently been online , those without a college degree saw greater rates of adoption over the past 15 years and have notably lowered the access gap . Adults with a college or graduate degree are the most likely to use the internet , with almost all of these adults ( 95 % ) saying they are internet users . This proportion has always been high – fifteen years ago , 78 % of adults with at least a college degree used the internet . But the situation in 2000 was much different for those with less education : in that year , only 19 % of those without a high school diploma reported that they were internet users . For those who have not completed high school , 66 % now use the internet , still below where college graduates were in 2000 .
Women are more likely than men to say that masks should always be worn in public places ( 53 % vs. 42 % ) . White people are substantially less likely than black and Hispanic adults to say that masks should always be worn . Age is also strongly related to views about mask wearing . About four-in-ten ( 42 % ) of those ages 18 to 29 say that masks should always be worn , compared with 55 % of those 65 and older .
The key Senate vote that halted gun control legislation last week is drawing a mixed reaction from the American public : 47 % express negative feelings about the vote while 39 % have a positive reaction to the Senate 's rejection of gun control legislation that included background checks on gun purchases .

On the other side , 20 % say are very happy the legislation was blocked , while 19 % say they are relieved .
Despite these religious differences , Millennials celebrate many of the cultural parts of Christmas at roughly equal rates to older Americans – and sometimes at even higher rates . For instance , about nine-in-ten Millennials ( 91 % ) said they planned to buy gifts for friends or family during the 2013 holiday season , higher than the share of members of the Silent generation ( 79 % ) and Baby Boomers ( 86 % ) who said the same . And Millennials are at least as likely as their elders to say they planned to attend a gathering with extended family or friends , put up a Christmas tree or go caroling . The one exception among the cultural traditions mentioned in the survey is the sending of Christmas or holiday cards . Members of the Silent generation ( 76 % ) , Baby Boomers ( 68 % ) and Generation Xers ( 65 % ) are all more likely than Millennials ( 57 % ) to say they send such cards .
In U.S. congressional races nationwide , an estimated 69 % of Latinos voted for the Democratic candidate and 29 % backed the Republican candidate , a more than two-to-one advantage for Democrats , according to National Election Pool exit poll data . These results largely reflect the party affiliation of Latinos . In a Pew Research Center pre-election survey , 62 % of Latinos said they identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party compared with 27 % who affiliated with the Republican Party . Among other racial and ethnic groups , a lower share of whites ( 44 % ) voted for Democrats in congressional races compared with blacks ( 90 % ) and Asians ( 77 % ) . ( Exit polls offer the first look at who voted in an election , a portrait that will be refined over time as more data , such as state voter files , become available . )
As was the case in January , far more Americans say Trump 's economic policies have made U.S. economic conditions better ( 44 % ) than worse ( 23 % ) , while 30 % say they have not had much of an effect . These attitudes – like views of the economy itself – are divided by partisanship . Republicans overwhelmingly say that Trump 's policies have made the economy better ( 79 % say this ) . Just 13 % of Democrats say Trump 's policies have made conditions better , while the remainder are about equally likely to say that his policies have not had much effect ( 42 % ) or have made economic conditions worse ( 41 % ) .
While mobile networks in sub-Saharan Africa have spread rapidly , landline penetration in the seven countries surveyed is close to zero . A median of only 2 % across these nations say they have a working landline telephone in their house , with a median of 97 % saying they do not have one . There is little variation across the countries on landline ownership . Landlines are simply rare on the continent . By contrast , 60 % of Americans have a landline telephone in their household . ( However , the share of wireless-only households in the U.S. has been growing rapidly over the past decade as landline ownership falls . )
The U.S. is the leading defense spender among member states , committing an estimated 3.87 % of GDP to defense expenditures in 2020 . Nine other countries – including several in Central and Eastern Europe – also meet NATO 's 2 % threshold . Just one country – Luxembourg – spends less than 1 % of GDP on defense .
Americans have mixed views about genetically modified foods ( GMOs ) and their implications for society . About half of U.S. adults ( 51 % ) think GMOs are worse for people 's health than foods with no genetically modified ingredients , while 41 % say GM foods have a neutral effect on health . Just 7 % say they are better for health than other foods . As Americans think about the effects of GMOs , about three-quarters ( 74 % ) say it is at least fairly likely that GM foods will increase the global food supply . And 62 % say GM foods are very or fairly likely to lead to more affordably priced food .
Partisanship is a stronger factor in people 's beliefs about climate change than is their level of knowledge and understanding about science . In October 2019 , roughly nine-in-ten Democrats with a high level of knowledge about science ( 89 % ) said human activity contributes a great deal to climate change , compared with 41 % of Democrats with low science knowledge , based on an 11-item knowledge index . By contrast , Republicans with a high level of science knowledge were no more likely than those with a low level of knowledge to say human activity plays a strong role in climate change . A similar pattern was found regarding people 's beliefs about energy issues . These findings illustrate that the relationship between people 's level of science knowledge and their attitudes can be complex .
Views on this question also vary by education . About half of college graduates ( 52 % ) say it 's better for children to have a parent staying home , compared with 59 % of those with some college experience and 64 % of those with a high school education or less .
Opinions of Israel 's prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , are basically unchanged from last year . About as many say they have a favorable view ( 31 % ) as an unfavorable opinion ( 28 % ) of Netanyahu ; 41 % express no opinion of Israel 's prime minister .
African immigrants make up a small share of the nation 's immigrant population , but their overall numbers are growing – roughly doubling every decade since 1970 , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data . There were 2.1 million African immigrants living in the United States in 2015 , up from 881,000 in 2000 and a substantial increase from 1970 when the U.S. was home to only 80,000 foreign-born Africans . They accounted for 4.8 % of the U.S. immigrant population in 2015 , up from 0.8 % in 1970 .
A large majority of Republicans ( 71 % ) said that government aid to the poor does more harm than good , but there are divisions within the party based on income , according to the February survey . Eight-in-ten Republicans with annual incomes of $ 75,000 or more say government aid to the poor does more harm than good , as do 71 % of those with incomes of $ 30,000- $ 74,999 . But lower-income Republicans are less likely to agree . Among those with incomes of less than $ 30,000 , 48 % say it does more good than harm while 45 % say it does more harm than good .
The vast majority of cellphone-using teens say their phone is a way to just pass time , with nine-in-ten saying they often or sometimes use it this way , according to a Pew Research Center survey of 13- to 17-year-olds conducted in 2018 . Similarly large shares of teen cellphone users say they at least sometimes use their phone to connect with other people ( 84 % ) or learn new things ( 83 % ) . But while phones are a way for teens to connect with other people , they can also be a way to avoid face-to-face interactions . Roughly four-in-ten teen cellphone users ( 43 % ) say they often or sometimes use their phone to avoid interacting with people . This is truer for teen girls than teen boys . Roughly half of teen girls who have access to a cellphone ( 54 % ) say they often or sometimes use their mobile device to avoid social interaction , while 31 % of teen boys report doing the same .
Yet those who rely on mobile devices for online access face job-seeking challenges , ranging from data caps on a smartphone plan to attempting to craft a resume or apply for a job on a device that was not built for extensive text entry . One-quarter of `` smartphone only '' users have used a smartphone to fill out a job application online , and 13 % have used a smartphone to create a resume or cover letter .
India replaces China as the world 's most populous country : India 's population is expected to increase by 400 million by 2050 . Its projected population of 1.6 billion will be almost equal to the populations of the U.S. and China combined . China is projected to add only 25 million residents .
The global economic mood has improved somewhat in recent years , but many are still pessimistic about the future . In the United States , Japan and several European nations , economic confidence has rebounded from the depths of the Great Recession . For instance , 78 % of Germans believe their national economy is in good shape , compared with just 28 % in 2009 . However , in many advanced economies positive assessments of current economic conditions do not translate into optimism for the future . Only 36 % of Germans think that when children in their country grow up they will be financially better off than their parents . Similarly , while nearly two-thirds of Americans say economic conditions are good , only one-in-three are optimistic about the next generation 's financial prospects .
Despite concerns about politicians and about the current state of democracy more generally , most Czechs ( 80 % ) approved of the change from a one-party to a multiparty system that took place in the early 1990s . Elsewhere in the region , support for the political changes was also strong ; majorities in all of the former Eastern European publics surveyed except Ukraine embraced the move to competitive politics . But , only the east Germans ( 85 % ) edged Czechs out in support of the move to a competitive election system .
Today , 76 % of Republicans have a cold view of Democrats ( rating them 0 - 49 on the 0 - 100 scale ) , with about half ( 53 % ) rating Democrats very coldly ( 0 - 24 ) . Very cold ratings for Democrats among Republicans are higher today than in December 2016 ( 33 % ) , after the election , or in March of last year ( 46 % ) during the primary campaign .
Among the public overall , 30 % say they support legalizing marijuana use and have always felt that way , while 21 % have changed their minds ; they say there was a time when they thought it should be illegal . By contrast , 35 % say they oppose legalization and have always felt that way ; just 7 % have changed their minds from supporting to opposing legalization .
Large majorities of Hispanics and the general public ( both 70 % ) say the new coronavirus poses a major threat to the U.S. economy . But on other questions , Latinos ' concerns are more pronounced than those of the wider public . About two-thirds ( 65 % ) of Hispanic adults say the coronavirus outbreak is a major threat to the health of the U.S. population as a whole , compared with about half ( 47 % ) of the general public . More Hispanics than Americans overall say the outbreak is a major threat to their personal financial situation ( 50 % vs. 34 % ) , day-to-day life in their local community ( 49 % vs. 36 % ) and their personal health ( 39 % vs. 27 % ) .
As people have gained more access to computers and cell phones , internet and email usage have also increased . A median of 45 % across the 18 countries for which 2007 trends are available now say they use the internet at least occasionally ; three years ago , when the Pew Global Attitudes Project first asked this question , a median of 35 % said that was the case . The median percentage that sends or receives email at least occasionally has also risen , although not as steeply , from 29 % in 2007 to 34 % in 2010 .
As in previous Pew Research surveys of social networking usage , Facebook remains the dominant player in the social networking space . Some 71 % of online adults are now Facebook users , a slight increase from the 67 % of online adults who used Facebook as of late 2012 .
Almost half—47 % —of adults own an iPod or other mp3 player . However , among the devices examined in this report , mp3 players saw the widest range in ownership rates between generations . While 74 % of Millennials own an mp3 player , only 56 % of members of Gen X do—and adoption rates continue to drop for each of the older generations . Only 3 % of adults age 75 and older own this type of device .
Especially in the United States , political leaning plays a role in views of Russia . Roughly six-in-ten Democrats ( 61 % ) view Russia as a major risk to national security , whereas only 36 % of Republicans feel the same .
Amid the breakdown of peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators , the public is divided over whether a way can be found for a peaceful two-state solution in the Middle East . Overall , 46 % say an independent Palestinian state can coexist peacefully with Israel , 44 % do not think this can happen . A year ago , 50 % thought it was possible for an independent Palestinian state to exist peacefully alongside Israel , 41 % did not .
The rise in support for same-sex marriage has been confirmed by every major national survey organization tracking the issue . But the balance of opinion differs based on the wording of the question . The Pew Research Center question asks : `` Do you strongly favor , favor , oppose , or strongly oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally ? '' The March 13 - 17 survey finds 49 % in favor and 44 % opposed . A Washington Post/ABC News survey , conducted March 7 - 10 , asks a different question : `` Do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married ? '' This question has consistently elicited a higher level of support for same-sex marriage ; the latest survey found 58 % saying legal and 36 % illegal . These two surveys show that more Americans oppose making same-sex marriage legal ( 44 % in the Pew Research Center poll ) than favor making it illegal ( 36 % in the Washington Post/ABC News poll ) . Both organizations have tracked their questions since 2003 , and the Washington Post/ABC News poll has consistently found higher support for same-sex marriage . However , the two polls tell the same story : significant growth in support for same-sex marriage over the last 10 years .
A proposal by President Obama to offer free tuition for students attending community college could have a significant impact on Hispanics . More Hispanics are already enrolled in college than ever before and , among those who are , nearly half ( 46 % ) attend a public two-year school , the highest share of any race or ethnicity , according to U.S. Department of Education data .
Those who favor right-wing populist parties in Europe express less support for freedom of religion – with two exceptions . In most cases , Europeans who support right-wing populist parties are less supportive of freedom of religion than those who do not hold favorable views of these parties . For example , only 30 % of those who favor the Sweden Democrats party say it is very important that people can practice their religion freely , while 62 % of those with an unfavorable view of Sweden Democrats say the same . However , those who hold favorable views of right-wing populist parties in Poland and Spain are more likely to support freedom of religion than those who have unfavorable views of these parties .
Overall , nearly nine-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents ( 87 % ) and about seven-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 71 % ) said they had a fair amount or great deal of confidence in police officers to act in the best interests of the public . But there were wide divisions between black and white Democrats in their confidence in police officers . While 78 % of white Democrats said they had at least a fair amount of confidence in officers to act in the public 's best interests , just 54 % of black Democrats said the same .
About two-in-ten ( 18 % ) say they very closely followed news about possible candidates for the 2012 presidential election . That 's about the same level of interest as the previous week . Just 6 % say this was the news they followed most closely . News about the campaign made up 8 % of coverage , more than doubling its previous high this year , according to PEJ .
Eight-in-ten Americans say they had heard a lot ( 29 % ) or a little ( 52 % ) about an international health panel warning of a possible link between cell phone use and brain cancer . As is usually the case with health-related stories , women had heard more about this story than had men ( 33 % heard a lot versus 25 % ) .
Most Americans say climate change is having at least some impact on their local community , but this sentiment is more common among Democrats than Republicans . About six-in-ten U.S. adults ( 62 % ) say climate change is affecting their local community at least some , including 22 % who say it 's impacting their community a great deal . Democrats ( 82 % ) are much more likely than Republicans ( 38 % ) to say climate change is affecting the community they live in .
The public and the news media divided their attention last week among the top international stories , harsh winter weather , politics and the ongoing saga surrounding the death of Anna Nicole Smith . The Iraq war remained the No . 1 story both in terms of public interest and news coverage , however , the public hung on to the Anna Nicole Smith story , even as press coverage began to taper off .
Other religious groups also have a higher percentage of college graduates than the full sample of more than 35,000 U.S. adults surveyed in the 2014 Religious Landscape Study , among whom 27 % completed university . They include Buddhists and members of the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) – both at 47 % – as well as Orthodox Christians ( 40 % ) , Muslims ( 39 % ) and Mormons ( 33 % ) .
In the context of these developments , a Pew Research Center survey of adults in 11 emerging economies finds these publics are worried about the risks associated with social media and other communications technologies – even as they cite their benefits in other respects . Succinctly put , the prevailing view in the surveyed countries is that mobile phones , the internet and social media have collectively amplified politics in both positive and negative directions – simultaneously making people more empowered politically and potentially more exposed to harm . When it comes to the benefits , adults in these countries see digital connectivity enhancing people 's access to political information and facilitating engagement with their domestic politics . Majorities in each country say access to the internet , mobile phones and social media has made people more informed about current events , and majorities in most countries believe social media have increased ordinary people 's ability to have a meaningful voice in the political process . Additionally , half or more in seven of these 11 countries say technology has made people more accepting of those who have different views than they do . But these perceived benefits are frequently accompanied by concerns about the limitations of technology as a tool for political action or information seeking . Even as many say social media have increased the influence of ordinary people in the political process , majorities in eight of these 11 countries feel these platforms have simultaneously increased the risk that people might be manipulated by domestic politicians . Around half or more in eight countries also think these platforms increase the risk that foreign powers might interfere in their country 's elections .
Online daters widely believe that dishonesty is a pervasive issue on these platforms . A clear majority of online daters ( 71 % ) say it is very common for people on these platforms to lie about themselves to appear more desirable , while another 25 % think it is somewhat common . Only 3 % of online daters think this is not a common occurrence on dating platforms . Smaller , but still substantial shares , of online daters believe people setting up fake accounts in order to scam others ( 50 % ) or people receiving sexually explicit messages or images they did not ask for ( 48 % ) are very common on dating sites and apps . By contrast , online daters are less likely to think harassment or bullying , and privacy violations , such as data breaches or identify theft , are very common occurrences on these platforms .
Partisans rate their parties . Most Republicans and Republican leaners ( 57 % ) say their party is not doing a good job of representing their views on same-sex marriage , and the party draws criticism from those on both sides of the issue .
Education , jobs and the economy , and health care are the top issues for Hispanic registered voters . Some 55 % of registered voters say the issue of education is extremely important to them , followed by 54 % who cite jobs and the economy , and 50 % who cite health care . These three top issues are the same as those cited by Hispanic registered voters in December 2011 ( Lopez , Gonzalez-Barrera and Motel , 2011 ) . About a third ( 34 % ) of Hispanic registered voters say immigration is extremely important to them personally ; similar shares say the same about the federal budget deficit ( 36 % ) and taxes ( 33 % ) .
When it comes to who will be targeted by made-up news in 2020 , 51 % of Democrats say this kind of misinformation will mostly be intended to hurt the Democratic Party , while just 4 % say it will be intended to hurt the Republican Party . Another 36 % of Democrats say such news will be intended to hurt both parties about equally .
Moderate and liberal Republicans ' views on checks on presidential power have not shifted during this period . Currently , 27 % of moderates and liberals say presidents would be more effective if they were less concerned about the courts and Congress , while a 68 % majority say it would be too risky to give them more power .
Expectations also vary by self-reported familiarity with gene editing . Those who have heard a lot about gene editing to change a baby 's genetic characteristics are more inclined to anticipate positive outcomes from its widespread use . Some 36 % of this group thinks it is very likely that the widespread availability of gene editing would pave the way for new medical advances that are beneficial to society , compared with about half as many of those who have heard a little or nothing about gene editing ( 16 % ) . However , those most familiar with gene editing are more likely than those with no familiarity to also anticipate downsides . About two-thirds of those who have heard a lot about gene editing ( 64 % ) say it is very likely that widespread availability of gene editing will increase inequality because the technology will primarily be available only for the wealthy , compared with 53 % of those who have heard nothing about using gene editing to change a baby 's genetic characteristics . And , 65 % of those who have heard a lot about gene editing think it 's very likely that others will use these techniques in morally unacceptable ways , while 54 % of those who have heard a little and 52 % of those who have heard nothing about gene editing say this .
Majorities of urban and rural residents also say people who do n't live in their type of community have at least a somewhat negative view of those who do ( 63 % in urban and 56 % in rural areas say this ) , while a much smaller share in suburban areas ( 36 % ) say their type of community is seen negatively by those in other areas .
The smartphone is essential for many owners , but a slight majority says it 's not always needed . Some 46 % of smartphone owners said their smartphone is something `` they could n't live without , '' compared with 54 % who said in a 2014 Pew Research Center survey that their phone is `` not always needed . '' Perhaps surprisingly , smartphone owners who depend on their mobile device for internet access are not significantly more inclined than those who have multiple options for going online to say they could n't live without their phone ( 49 % vs. 46 % ) . In addition to being essential for many , smartphone owners are much more likely to have positive views of these devices . For instance , they are much more likely to say smartphones are more helpful than annoying , represent freedom rather than represent a leash , enable connecting rather than being distracting and are worth the cost rather than being a financial burden .
Among those with a postgraduate degree , 95 % of Democrats feel colleges and universities are very or somewhat open to a wide range of opinions and viewpoints . Just 46 % of Republican postgraduates say the same . And among those with no college experience , 83 % of Democrats say higher education is open to differing viewpoints , compared with just 45 % of Republicans .
Online career and job-related resources : Some 62 % of local libraries offer such resources , according to IPAC , and 41 % of adults in our survey say they know their local libraries have such material . Still , 38 % say they do not know if such resources are offered by their local libraries and another 21 % say their libraries do not offer career- and job-related resources .
Gasoline and energy prices are far and away the most talked about issues among Americans today . Three-quarters say that it is a subject that comes up `` frequently '' in conversations with family and friends , and it is a topic of discussion among people of all walks of life and political persuasions . The economy , the war in Iraq , education , and health care are also frequent topics of conversation for most Americans . Far fewer have regular conversations about government corruption , Social Security or the environment , and just 14 % say the topic of gay marriage comes up frequently .
The executive actions build on 2012 's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) , which granted relief to young adults who came to the U.S. as children . This program has resulted in nearly 700,000 people receiving relief , though advocates said the action did not go far enough .
The survey asked teens to rank the types of contact information they would most commonly share with a new friend . About half of teens ( 52 % ) told us that a phone number for calling is one of the first three types of information they would share , but only 9 % say this is the first contact information they would exchange . By comparison , 80 % of teens share their phone number for texting with a new friend , and 54 % say it is the first thing they would give to a new friend .
Notably , the least financially secure have a mixed view of government performance . About half ( 49 % ) say the `` government is almost always wasteful and inefficient , '' while nearly as many ( 48 % ) say government `` often does a better job than people give it credit for . '' But among the two most financially secure groups , roughly six-in-ten fault the government for being wasteful and inefficient .
The percentage of Americans who have listened to a podcast has also substantially increased over the last decade . As of 2019 , 51 % of Americans ages 12 or older have ever listened to a podcast , according to Edison Research and Triton Digital survey data , and 32 % have listened to a podcast in the past month , up from 26 % in 2018 and just 9 % in 2008 . Furthermore , 22 % of those 12 and older said they have listened to a podcast in the last week , up from 7 % when this was first measured in 2013 . ( The data in this chart , as well as in the subsequent chart about podcasts , is for all types of listening and do not break out news programs . )
In the eyes of Americans , the second-most memorable event in modern U.S.-German relations has been the fall of the Berlin Wall : 28 % say that is their most significant memory . Other moments in postwar relations hardly register : 8 % cite the disagreement between the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush and of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder over the Iraq War , 7 % mention U.S. monitoring of German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's communications , and just 3 % name the postwar Marshall Plan .
2 Americans and Germans differ over which country is most important to their own nation 's foreign policy . In the U.S. , people are most likely to name the UK ( 36 % ) as the most or second-most important foreign policy partner for the U.S. Only about one-in-ten ( 13 % ) name Germany , ranking it fifth on Americans ' list .
This second survey , conducted May 29 to June 11 , 2018 , reveals that social media users generally believe it would be relatively easy for the platforms they use to determine key traits about them based on the data they have amassed about their behaviors . Majorities of social media users say it would be very or somewhat easy for these platforms to determine their race or ethnicity ( 84 % ) , their hobbies and interests ( 79 % ) , their political affiliation ( 71 % ) or their religious beliefs ( 65 % ) . Some 28 % of social media users believe it would be difficult for these platforms to figure out their political views , nearly matching the share of Facebook users who are assigned a political listing but believe that listing is not very or not at all accurately .
In the Center 's survey , there 's no clear consensus among the public as to whether sharing this information with medical researchers is acceptable or not . About four-in-ten Americans ( 41 % ) say it is acceptable for makers of fitness trackers to share users ' data with medical researchers seeking to better understand the link between exercise and heart disease , while a somewhat smaller share ( 35 % ) believes this is an unacceptable practice . Another 22 % are unsure if this is an acceptable practice or not . Some groups find the use of this data more acceptable than others . White adults ( 39 % ) are more likely than those who are black ( 31 % ) or Hispanic ( 26 % ) to see sharing this data as unacceptable . At the same time , 47 % of adults under the age of 50 believe that sharing this type of data with researchers is acceptable , compared with 35 % of those 50 and older .
Religious differences also extend to questions about societal acceptance of transgender people . Most white evangelical Protestants ( 61 % ) say society has `` gone too far '' when it comes to accepting people who are transgender . And Pew Research Center polling conducted in the summer of 2016 found that seven-in-ten white evangelical Protestants think that transgender people should be required to use the public restrooms that correspond with their birth gender . By comparison , other Christian groups are more evenly divided on these questions . And most religious `` nones '' ( 57 % ) say society has `` not gone far enough '' when it comes to accepting people who are transgender , and that transgender individuals should be allowed to use public restrooms corresponding to their current gender identity ( 70 % ) .
A broad majority of Tunisians ( 81 % ) express dissatisfaction with the way things are going in their country . Fewer than two-in-ten ( 17 % ) say they are satisfied with the country 's direction . Just 13 % of 18 - 29 year olds are satisfied , while slightly more of those 50 and over ( 24 % ) express satisfaction with national conditions .
Among Latinos and Asians , the voter turnout rate in 2018 for naturalized citizens was higher than among the U.S. born . The naturalized-citizen turnout rate among Latinos was 44.2 % , higher than the 39.0 % turnout for U.S.-born Latinos . ( Naturalized citizens are immigrants who have become U.S. citizens . Latinos and Asians are the nation 's two largest immigrant groups . ) This gap between the Latino groups narrowed from 2014 , when turnout was 35.2 % and 24.2 % , respectively . For Asians , naturalized citizens had a turnout rate of 42.7 % compared with 36.7 % for those born in the U.S. Those figures are up from 29.6 % and 22.4 % in 2014 . Among all U.S. eligible voters , by contrast , the 2018 turnout rate of naturalized citizens trailed that of the U.S. born , 45.7 % to 54.2 % , a similar pattern as in recent elections .
Throughout the 20th century , college-educated adults in the United States had been less likely than their less-educated counterparts to be married by age 30 . In 1990 , for example , 75 % of all 30-year-olds who did not have a college degree were married or had been married , compared with just 69 % of those with a college degree .
The public is closely split on some other major debates surrounding the content of games and their impact on users . For instance , a quarter of all adults ( 26 % ) think most video games are a waste of time , while 24 % think most games are not a waste of time . One-third think some games are a waste of time while others are not . And 16 % of the public is unsure what to think about this issue . A similar pattern is evident on the question of whether or not `` most games help develop good problem solving and strategic thinking skills . '' Some 17 % of adults think this is true of most games , while 16 % think this is not true of most games . Additionally , 47 % think this is true of some games but not others , and 20 % are not sure . Asked whether games promote teamwork and communication , 23 % of adults do not think most games promote these traits – more than double the 10 % who think most games do promote these qualities . Some 37 % think some games but not others promote teamwork and communication , while 28 % say they are unsure . Similarly , 30 % of adults do not think most games are a better form of entertainment than TV , almost triple the 11 % who think this is true .
More than half of teens have made at least one new friend online . Fully 57 % of teenagers have met a new friend over the internet , with nearly three-in-ten teens ( 29 % ) saying they have made more than five friends this way . But most of these relationships remain online , with a majority ( 77 % ) of all teenagers saying they have never met an online friend in person . Social media sites are popular places for teens to make friends online : About two-thirds ( 64 % ) of teens who have met a friend online say they have met new friends via a social networking site . Additionally , a majority of teens say social media platforms have made them feel more connected to their friends ' lives and feelings . Roughly eight-in-ten social-media-using teens ( 83 % ) say that sites like Facebook or Instagram make them feel more connected to what is happening in their friends ' lives , while 70 % say these social platforms make them feel more in tune with their friends ' feelings .
Good neighbors can be a blessing , whether they 're people you can trust to water the plants or watch the kids . But building that trust can be hard : Just half of Americans ( 52 % ) say they trust all or most of their neighbors , while a similar share ( 48 % ) say they trust some or none of their neighbors , according to a 2015 Pew Research Center survey .
The digital video advertising market is relatively small , but it is growing rapidly . According to eMarketer , digital video advertising in 2013 accounted for about 10 % of the overall digital advertising market . But digital video ad revenue reached $ 4.15 billion in 2013 , which represents a 44 % increase from 2012 and almost a tripling of the revenue from 2010 . YouTube is estimated to account for 20.5 % of that that $ 4.15 billion in digital video advertising , and eMarketer estimates that its share will continue to grow , leaving fewer ad dollars for news organizations .
A large majority of Filipinos ( 86 % ) hold a favorable opinion of Duterte , with 41 % holding a very favorable opinion of the president . Only 12 % of Filipinos have an unfavorable view of Duterte .
Few in the countries surveyed have confidence in the leader of either the U.S. or China , and many are critical of how both countries have handled the coronavirus outbreak . On most measures included in the survey , people are even more critical of the U.S. than of China – though more still have favorable opinions of the U.S . Most people rate China more positively than the U.S. in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic . Across the 14 countries surveyed , few praise China 's response to COVID-19 , with a median of 37 % saying it has done a good job dealing with the outbreak . But , in all countries except Japan and the U.S. itself , people are much more complimentary of China 's response than that of the U.S . In Japan , fewer than one-in-five praise either country . The gap is largest in Italy , where 51 % say China has done a good job compared with 18 % who say the same of the U.S. , a difference of 33 percentage points . Gaps of around 30 points exist across most of the Western European countries surveyed .
A majority of Black Americans ( 57 % ) say they personally know someone who has been hospitalized or died as a result of having COVID-19 . Some 46 % of Hispanic adults say the same , compared with about a third of White ( 34 % ) and Asian adults ( 32 % ) . The share of Hispanic Americans who know someone who has been hospitalized or died due to COVID-19 has more than doubled since the spring survey , when 19 % said this .
Among those who identify solely as Taiwanese , there is little enthusiasm about the mainland . Favorable views of the U.S. among this group are three times higher than toward mainland China ( 75 % vs. 23 % ) . But , among those who identify as both Chinese and Taiwanese , majorities have favorable views of both the U.S. and mainland China .
In fiscal 2016 , which ended Sept. 30 , the U.S. resettled nearly 85,000 refugees within its borders , the most since 1999 . As in Europe , there has been much discussion in the U.S. about which refugees should be admitted , both in terms of their origins and their religious affiliations . The U.S. has seen a shift in the origins of refugees , with most in recent years coming from Asia , Africa and the Middle East . During the 1990s , most were from Europe . At the same time , a record number of U.S. refugees in fiscal 2016 were Muslim , with most coming from Syria and Somalia . Refugees are resettled all over the U.S. , but more than half ( 54 % ) were resettled in just 10 states .
Blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in the STEM workforce . Overall , blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in the STEM workforce relative to their shares in the U.S. workforce as a whole . This underrepresentation is evident across all STEM job clusters , with one exception : 11 % of health care practitioners and technicians are black , similar to the share of blacks in the total workforce .
A median of 69 % of adults across the 20 global publics favor expanding the use of natural gas , including about two-thirds or more in 16 of those places .

Public attitudes about the measles , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine remain broadly positive in the United States , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . An overwhelming majority of U.S. adults ( 88 % ) say the benefits of the MMR vaccine outweigh the risks – the same share as in 2016 , when the Center last asked this question – while the share who consider its preventive health benefits to be `` very high '' has grown by 11 percentage points during that time ( from 45 % to 56 % ) . A 69 % majority of Americans consider the risk of side effects from the vaccine to be either low or very low , about the same as in 2016 .
In most of the countries surveyed , relatively few people ( median of 34 % ) have access to a desktop computer , laptop or tablet in their household . The exception is Lebanon , where a majority of adults ( 57 % ) say they have access to such a device . As with most other measures of technological connectedness , those who are younger and more educated are generally more likely to have access to a computer or tablet at home .
Other than education , getting and keeping jobs has been key to improved Hispanic economic prospects . From its high in 1992 , the overall unemployment rate dropped by half to 5.7 in 2000 . However , in December 2001 , Latino unemployment stood at 7.8 percent , compared to 4.4 percent for whites . Relative to native-born Latinos , immigrants have had lower rates of unemployment during this period of growth . How this story plays out in the current recession remains to be seen . Hispanics are heavily reliant on employment with few alternative sources of income : 68 percent of Hispanic adults are in the labor force . Among the major Hispanic populations , Cubans had the highest rate of unemployment at 10 percent , with a 57 percent labor force participation rate . Mexican Americans had an unemployment rate of 8.1 percent and nearly 70 percent of them were in the labor force . Latinos of Central and South American origin had an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent and more than 72 percent of these Latinos were in the labor force .
There also are race , age and educational differences in these views . Whites are divided ( 48 % favor , 48 % oppose ) , while large majorities of Hispanics ( 73 % ) and blacks ( 71 % ) oppose expanding the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border .
Furthermore , Americans who believe gun laws should be less strict are more likely to contact public officials on the issue than those who think gun laws should be stricter or are about right ( 22 % have ever done so , compared with 15 % of those who favor stricter laws and 10 % of those who think laws are about right ) . Among gun owners , 19 % of those who want less strict laws have contacted a public official in the past year , compared with 9 % of those who want stricter laws .
About three-in-four Americans ( 73 % ) say it 's likely that social media sites intentionally censor political viewpoints they find objectionable , according to the June survey . Public perceptions have not changed much since the question was last asked in May and June of 2018 . And while majorities in both parties believe censorship is likely occurring , Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say this ( 90 % vs. 59 % ) .
Regardless of people 's intention to get vaccinated , 62 % of Americans report they would be uncomfortable being among the first to do so . Roughly two-thirds of those who say they would `` probably '' be vaccinated are uncomfortable being among the first as are nearly all of those who say they would not be vaccinated if a vaccine were available today . The exception comes from the roughly three-in-ten U.S. adults ( 29 % ) who say they would definitely be vaccinated ; 82 % of this group say they would be comfortable being in the first groups to be immunized against coronavirus .
While less common than keeping in touch with the people in their lives , around half of online sub-Saharan Africans use the internet to get news and information about politics ( median of 53 % of internet users ) or public or government services ( 51 % ) . Another four-in-ten use it to access information about health and medicine ( 41 % ) .
The close ties between people in the U.S. and Mexico are reflected in the survey 's findings – 39 % of Mexicans have friends or relatives in the U.S. Nearly one-in-five ( 18 % ) Mexicans say they receive money from relatives living in another country , although this represents a slight decline from 2007 , when 23 % said they received money from outside .
9 A majority of Americans see gender discrimination as a problem in the tech industry . Tech companies have faced criticism for their hiring practices and work cultures , including reports of discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity and gender . A majority of Americans ( 73 % ) say discrimination against women is a problem in the tech industry , with 37 % citing it as a major problem , according to a summer 2017 survey . When it comes to discrimination against black and Hispanic Americans in tech – two groups that are underrepresented in the industry – roughly two-thirds of Americans ( 68 % ) say this is a problem ( 31 % say it 's a major problem ) , according to the same survey .
It 's common for social media users in the U.S. to see content about sexual harassment or assault . Roughly two-thirds ( 65 % ) of U.S. adults who use social media say that at least some of the content they see on these platforms pertains to sexual harassment or assault . This includes 29 % who say that a great deal of what they see on social media is focused on this issue , according to newly released data from a Pew Research Center survey conducted earlier this year . It is common for social media users from various demographic groups to encounter these types of posts . For example , men are as likely as women to report seeing at least some content related to sexual harassment or assault while using social media . In the immediate aftermath of prominent sexual harassment allegations in 2017 , some members of Congress addressed the issue on their official Facebook pages – but there was a large gender gap in doing so . More than four-in-ten members of Congress ( 44 % ) mentioned sexual misconduct in at least one post on their official Facebook accounts between Oct. 1 and Dec. 30 , 2017 , according to a previous Center analysis . Across both political parties , female legislators were far more likely than their male counterparts to raise the issue in their posts .
Overall , 58 % say North Korea 's leadership is not serious about addressing international concerns about their country 's nuclear enrichment program . This is higher than the share that said this in May 2018 ( 49 % ) . Today , 35 % say they think North Korea 's leadership is serious about addressing these concerns – similar to the share who expressed this view in 2018 .
The U.S. electorate is aging : 52 % of registered voters are ages 50 and older , up from 41 % in 1996 . This shift has occurred in both partisan coalitions . More than half of Republican and GOP-leaning voters ( 56 % ) are ages 50 and older , up from 39 % in 1996 . And among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters , half are 50 and older , up from 41 % in 1996 . Another way to consider the aging of the electorate is to look at median age . The median age among all registered voters increased from 44 in 1996 to 50 in 2019 . It rose from 43 to 52 among Republican registered voters and from 45 to 49 among Democratic registered voters .
There also are differences in views of financial regulations by age and education . Among Americans younger than 30 , just 33 % say the government has gone too far in regulating financial institutions , while more ( 52 % ) say it has not gone far enough . Older Americans are more divided in their views . Majorities of those with at least a four-year college degree say the government has n't gone far enough regulating financial institutions : 56 % say this , while just 34 % say regulation has gone too far . By comparison , a smaller share of those with no more than a high school diploma ( 41 % ) think there has not been enough regulation of the financial sector , while 51 % say the government has gone too far regulating these institutions .
Overall , Millennials ( currently ages 18 - 33 ) are the most liberal age group . In our report on Political Polarization in the American Public , we used a scale based on 10 political values questions about the role of government , the environment , homosexuality and other issues to measure ideological consistency . This survey of more than 10,000 Americans finds that , on this scale , Millennials are considerably more liberal than other generations : About four-in-ten Millennials are mostly ( 28 % ) or consistently ( 13 % ) liberal in their views , compared with 15 % who are mostly ( 12 % ) or consistently ( 3 % ) conservative ( 44 % are ideologically mixed ) . Older generations are progressively more conservative .
Americans by and large say that the United Kingdom is the preeminent foreign partner , with 27 % mentioning the UK as the most important foreign policy partner . A further 14 % of Americans name China and 10 % say Israel .
The public is divided over the best approach to confronting global terrorism . Overall , 45 % say `` using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world , '' while about as many ( 46 % ) say `` relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism . '' There are wide partisan differences on the question of force and global terrorism . Democrats are far more likely to say relying too much on force creates hatred that leads to more terrorism than to say using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world ( 66 % -27 % ) . By contrast , Republicans are more likely to see overwhelming force as the best way to defeat terrorism by a 72 % -18 % margin . Independents are more divided : 49 % say relying too much on force creates hatred , while 43 % say overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world .
The six countries where confidence in Merkel is now at its highest level on record are the United Kingdom ( where 76 % have confidence in her ) , Canada ( 74 % ) , Spain and Australia ( both 72 % ) , Japan ( 67 % ) and the United States ( 61 % ) . In France and Italy , confidence in Merkel was higher prior to the eurozone crisis than it is now . And in Japan , the Netherlands , South Korea and Sweden , more people had confidence in Merkel in the years following the height of the refugee crisis than currently .
The public places a great deal of personal importance on the right to vote . When asked about the importance of five rights and freedoms , the right to vote ranks about as high as any item on the list . Overall , 91 % of Americans say that the right to vote is essential to their sense of freedom . Only 7 % say it is important but not essential , and just 1 % says it is not important . A comparable share ( 92 % ) considers freedom of speech to be essential to their own sense of freedom . Large majorities also say the right to privacy ( 87 % ) and freedom of religion ( 85 % ) are essential to them . Views are more mixed when it comes to the right to own guns : 48 % say this is essential , while 33 % say it is important but not essential and 19 % say it is not important .
While Republicans are split over who would ultimately bear the cost of the wall , a wide majority thinks a border wall would lead to a reduction in illegal immigration into the U.S . Overall , 58 % of Republicans and Republican leaners say that a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border will lead to a major reduction in illegal immigration ; an additional 27 % say it would lead to a minor reduction . Just 13 % of Republicans think a border wall would not have much impact on illegal immigration . Conservative Republicans ( 65 % ) are more likely than moderate and liberal Republicans ( 44 % ) to say a border wall would lead to a major reduction in illegal immigration . Democrats have far less confidence that a border wall would curtail illegal immigration . About two-thirds ( 65 % ) say a wall would not have much impact , compared with only about a third who say it would lead to either a major ( 9 % ) or minor ( 24 % ) reduction in illegal immigration . A wide majority of liberal Democrats ( 71 % ) say a wall would not have much impact ; a somewhat smaller majority of conservative and moderate Democrats say the same ( 58 % ) . A little more than half of blacks ( 57 % ) and Hispanics ( 55 % ) say that a wall would not have much impact on reducing illegal immigration . Among whites , views are mixed : 38 % say a wall would not have much impact on illegal immigration , compared with 35 % who anticipate a major reduction and 25 % who anticipate a minor reduction .
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's approach to Pakistan is n't popular , but his handling of Kashmir is . Modi has shown a willingness to use both diplomacy and military force to engage Pakistan . But despite Modi 's overall popularity in India ( 88 % see him favorably ) , only 21 % of Indians approve of the way he is handling relations with Pakistan . This has stayed roughly constant since 2015 , when the question was first asked . In contrast , a clear majority ( 60 % ) of Indians approve of Modi 's approach toward Kashmir . Indians ages 18 to 29 are more likely to approve of Modi 's management of the Kashmir situation than those ages 50 and older ( 64 % versus 51 % ) .
One area of convergence is the broad support in both the U.S. and Germany for more cooperation with France and Japan . And similar majorities in the U.S. and Germany want to cooperate more with China . However , a greater share of Americans want to cooperate more with the UK ( 76 % ) than of Germans who say the same ( 51 % ) .
Opinions on the impact of government assistance to the poor are even more partisan than views on the fairness of the economic system and hard work and achievement . Overall , the public is split with 44 % saying government aid to the poor `` does more harm than good by making people too dependent on government assistance , '' while about as many ( 49 % ) say it does `` more good than harm because people ca n't get out of poverty until their basic needs are met . '' Republicans , by 71 % to 24 % , say government aid to the poor does more harm than good . Democrats take the opposite view and by a nearly identical margin ( 74 % to 21 % ) , say aid to the poor does more good than harm . A majority of those with family incomes of less than $ 30,000 a year ( 58 % ) say government aid to the poor does more good than harm . People in higher income groups are more divided .
Solid majorities of the general publics in Germany and Spain say that there is a natural conflict between being a devout Muslim and living in a modern society . But most Muslims in both of those countries disagree . And in France , the scene of recent riots in heavily Muslim areas , large percentages of both the general public and the Muslim minority population feel there is no conflict in being a devout Muslim and living in a modern society .
An estimated 2.3 million Hispanics of Cuban origin lived in the United States in 2017 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Cubans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Cuban origin ; this includes immigrants from Cuba and those who trace their family ancestry to Cuba . Cubans are the third-largest population ( tied with Salvadorans ) of Hispanic origin living in the United States , accounting for 4 % of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017 . Since 2000 , the Cuban-origin population has increased 84 % , growing from 1.2 million to 2.3 million over the period . At the same time , the Cuban foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 50 % , from 853,000 in 2000 to 1.3 million in 2017 . By comparison , Mexicans , the nation 's largest Hispanic origin group , constituted 36.6 million , or 62 % , of the Hispanic population in 2017 .
And while the UK and China rank in the top three positions across party lines , more Republicans ( 25 % ) than Democrats ( 5 % ) name Israel as a top foreign policy partner for the U.S . There are also significant partisan differences in opinion on views about Canada and Mexico .
There are more modest partisan divisions on other survey questions about the impact of higher education . In a study last year of attitudes about the state of American jobs , majorities in both parties – regardless of their level of educational attainment – said a four-year degree prepares someone very or somewhat well for a well-paying job in today 's economy . However , Democrats and Democratic leaners were more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say this ( 73 % vs. 62 % ) .
Among caregivers of older adults , most provide help to one aging adult , but 22 % provide help to two and 7 % provide help to three or more . Roughly half of these caregivers have been providing help for two years or less . More than a third have been providing care for five or more years .
Fully 83 % of AAAS scientists report that obtaining federal research funding is harder today than it was five years ago . More than four-in-ten say the same about industry funding ( 45 % ) and private foundation funding ( 45 % ) compared with five years ago . Further , when asked to consider each of seven potential issues as a `` serious problem for conducting high quality research today , '' fully 88 % of AAAS scientists say that a lack of funding for basic research is a serious problem , substantially more than any of the other issues considered .7
By nearly two-to-one ( 65 % to 33 % ) , Republicans with at least a four-year college degree hold unfavorable opinions of labor unions . By contrast , opinion is divided among Republicans who do not have a college degree ( 45 % unfavorable , 42 % favorable ) .
Such modest growth has not impressed many global publics , who are fairly gloomy about the current state of their economies . A median of 56 % in advanced economies say economic conditions are bad , while 55 % in emerging markets and 54 % in developing countries share this negative view . Half or more in seven of the 11 advanced economies surveyed say their economy is performing poorly . The most negative views are in Italy ( 88 % ) , France ( 85 % ) , South Korea ( 83 % ) and Spain ( 81 % ) . In contrast , 75 % in Germany , 57 % in Canada and 55 % in Australia believe their economy is doing well .
The survey found interesting differences between the global middle class and others in all of the 13 countries in this study , but these gaps were especially consistent in a few places . Notable differences were particularly common in Chile , Russia , Bulgaria , and South Africa . Looking at the 16 measures analyzed , on 14 of those middle class Chileans differed from lower income Chileans by at least five percentage points . Differences were only slightly less common in Russia ( 13 ) , Bulgaria ( 12 ) , and South Africa ( 12 ) .
In a historic decision , the Supreme Court ruled today that the 14th Amendment requires states to license marriages between people of the same sex . The decision affects the lives of tens of thousands of Americans : About half the country 's unmarried LGBT adults said they would like to get married someday , according to a 2013 Pew Research Center survey .
The idea that an independent Palestinian state can peacefully coexist with Israel has been the cornerstone of many Arab-Israeli peace initiatives in recent years . But while significant shares of Israeli Arabs and Jews are optimistic about the prospect of a two-state solution , the Arabs currently in the Palestinian territories are less so . Half of Israeli Arabs ( citizens and residents living within the boundaries of Israel , as defined in the 2008 census conducted by Israel 's Central Bureau of Statistics ) say it is possible for Israel and an independent Palestinian state to coexist peacefully together , according to 2015 Pew Research Center surveys . By contrast , less than one-third of Arabs living in the Palestinian territories say a two-state solution is possible ( 28 % ) . Jewish public opinion in Israel is divided on this question – 43 % say a two-state solution is possible , while 45 % disagree .
In the same survey , nearly half of U.S. adults ( 46 % ) named local news outlets as a major source for COVID-19 news – more than the share who named several other groups , including President Donald Trump and the coronavirus task force ( 31 % ) . Other local information sources were seen as important as well : For example , 36 % of adults said state and local elected officials were a major source of news about the outbreak , while 16 % said the same about friends , family and neighbors , and 8 % named community newsletters or Listservs . In all , 64 % of U.S. adults named at least one of these local information sources as a major source for coronavirus news .
There also is widespread disappointment among Muslims that Iraq did not put up more of a fight against the U.S. and its allies . Overwhelming majorities in Morocco ( 93 % ) , Jordan ( 91 % ) , Lebanon ( 82 % ) , Turkey ( 82 % ) , Indonesia ( 82 % ) , and the Palestinian Authority ( 81 % ) say they are disappointed the Iraqi military put up so little resistance . Many others around the world share that view , including people in South Korea ( 58 % ) , Brazil ( 50 % ) and Russia ( 45 % ) .
Much of the disaffection with the EU among Europeans can be attributed to Brussels ' handling of the refugee issue . In every country surveyed , overwhelming majorities disapprove of how Brussels has dealt with the problem . This includes 94 % of Greeks , 88 % of Swedes and 77 % of Italians . The strongest approval of EU management of the refugee crisis is in the Netherlands , but that backing is a tepid 31 % . The EU 's handling of economic issues is another huge source of disaffection with the institution . About nine-in-ten Greeks ( 92 % ) disapprove of how the EU has dealt with the ongoing economic crisis . Roughly two-thirds of the Italians ( 68 % ) , French ( 66 % ) and Spanish ( 65 % ) similarly disapprove . ( France and Spain are the two nations where the favorability of the EU has recently experienced the largest decline . ) Majorities in Sweden ( 59 % ) and the UK ( 55 % ) , including 84 % of UKIP supporters , also disapprove of the EU 's job in dealing with economic challenges . The strongest approval of Brussels ' economic efforts is in Poland and Germany ( both 47 % ) .
Overall , similar shares of registered voters are very or somewhat confident in Trump ( 51 % ) and Biden ( 48 % ) to make good decisions about economic policy , although voters are more likely to say they are very confident in Trump ( 33 % vs. 13 % ) . And about as many voters express confidence in Biden ( 46 % ) as Trump ( 43 % ) to effectively handle law enforcement and criminal justice issues . And more voters are confident in Biden than Trump to bring the country closer together . Still , fewer than half of voters are confident in Biden to help unify the country ( 45 % ) , while just 31 % are confident in Trump .
Americans were also asked about their expectations for space tourism in the next 50 years . The public is split over whether this will happen , with half saying that people will routinely travel in space as tourists by 2068 and half saying this will not happen . Americans are more skeptical about the possibility of colonies on other planets – an endeavor championed by space entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos . About one-third of Americans ( 32 % ) say people will build colonies on other planets that can be lived in for long periods by 2068 .
Still , the majority of Americans are not confident about the way companies will behave when it comes to using and protecting their personal data . Roughly seven-in-ten or more say they are not too or not at all confident that companies will admit mistakes and take responsibility when they misuse or compromise data ( 79 % ) , will be held accountable by government if they misuse data ( 75 % ) , or will use customers ' data in ways that people would feel comfortable with ( 69 % ) .
Overall , 52 % describe themselves as `` very concerned '' or `` somewhat concerned '' about government surveillance of Americans ' data and electronic communications , compared with 46 % who describe themselves as `` not very concerned '' or `` not at all concerned '' about the surveillance . When asked about more specific areas of concern over their own communications and online activities , respondents expressed somewhat lower levels of concern about electronic surveillance in various parts of their digital lives :
Additionally , in the spring of 2015 , Pakistanis were confident that the government was making progress in the fight against extremists . A 56 % majority said that Sharif 's government was making progress , with only 7 % saying the Islamabad was losing ground and 12 % saying things were about the same as in the past . As is typical of Pakistani public opinion , a quarter did not offer an opinion .
The proportion of young adults ages 18 - 29 who use the internet has always outpaced overall adoption levels among older groups . But while older adults still report lower levels of internet use today , seniors have the greatest rate of change since 2000 . In 2000 , 70 % of young adults used the internet and that figure has steadily grown to 96 % today . At the other end of the spectrum , 14 % of seniors used the internet in 2000 , while 58 % do so today . Not until 2012 did more than half of all adults ages 65 and older report using the internet .
Amid rising coronavirus cases and widespread protests over racial injustice , President Donald Trump 's approval rating has dropped among a wide range of religious groups , including white evangelical Protestants – though they remain strongly supportive . Roughly seven-in-ten white evangelical Protestants ( 72 % ) say they approve of the way Trump is handling his job , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted June 16 to 22 . That is a 6 percentage point drop from 78 % recorded in April , in line with the 5-point drop during that period among U.S. adults overall . The share of white evangelicals who say they `` very strongly '' approve of Trump 's performance is now at 59 % , down 8 points from 67 % in April . ( Pew Research Center also asked the presidential approval question in March of this year , at which time Trump 's rating was similar to results obtained in April . ) While no other religious group is as supportive of Trump as white evangelical Protestants – and his rating has slipped among most Christian groups in this analysis in recent months – the president continues to garner support from half or more of other white Christians . More than half of white Protestants who do not identify as evangelical ( 56 % ) say they approve of the job Trump is doing , as do 54 % of white Catholics – and roughly six-in-ten voters in these groups say they would vote for him if the election were held today . Again , Biden does not instill confidence in many of these white Christians ; just one-in-five white Protestants who are not evangelical ( 19 % ) and white Catholics ( 21 % ) say that Biden would make a good or great president .
Americans think automation will likely disrupt a number of professions – but relatively few think their own jobs are at risk . A majority of U.S. adults say it is at least somewhat likely that jobs such as fast food workers ( 77 % ) and insurance claims processors ( 65 % ) will be mostly performed by machines in their lifetime , while around half expect that the same will be true of jobs such as software engineers and legal clerks . On the other hand , only three-in-ten workers think it 's at least somewhat likely that their own jobs will be mostly done by robots or computers during their lifetimes .
Yet among partisans who have heard a lot about the issue , the partisan gap over the decision to withdraw is even wider than in the public overall . Roughly two-thirds of Republicans who have heard a lot about the withdrawal ( 66 % ) say this would be the right decision , compared with 27 % who say it would not be . Among Democrats who have heard a lot about the plan to withdraw , nearly eight-in-ten ( 79 % ) view it as the wrong decision , while just 16 % say it would be the right decision .
The public broadly supports proposals to help homeowners and renters and businesses address economic problems resulting from the coronavirus outbreak . Nearly nine-in-ten ( 88 % each ) – including large majorities in both parties – support aid for these groups .
In the 2013 survey , 84 % of LGBT adults said love was a very important reason to get married ; in a survey of the general public that year , 88 % shared that view . By wide margins , companionship and lifelong commitment were the next-most important reasons for LGBT adults , as well as for U.S. adults overall .
Younger adults are using online streaming services as their go-to platform for watching television . About six-in-ten Americans ages 18 to 29 ( 61 % ) report that online streaming is the primary way they watch television , according to Center survey data from August . Smaller shares of 18- to 29-year-olds said their primary way of watching TV is via a cable or satellite subscription or through a digital antenna . By comparison , older age groups were more likely to say cable or satellite is their primary way of watching TV .
The notion that age and political ideology are related goes back at least to French monarchist statesman François Guizot , who originated the oft-mangled quotation , `` Not to be a republican at 20 is proof of want of heart ; to be one at 30 is proof of want of head . '' But data from the Pew Research Center 's new political typology report indicate that , while different age cohorts do have markedly different profiles , the relationship is considerably more complex than young=liberal and old=conservative . The report , based on a survey of more than 10,000 Americans , finds that among the oldest Americans ( those ages 65 and up ) , nearly two-thirds are at opposite ends of the typology . 32 % fall into the two strongest Republican-oriented groups ( what we call Steadfast Conservatives and Business Conservatives ) and 33 % are either Solid Liberals or Faith and Family Left , the two strongest Democratic-aligned groups . ( Steadfast and Business Conservatives are separated mainly by the latter 's more Wall Street orientation , while the Faith and Family Left tend to be more conservative on social issues than Solid Liberals . )
The Indians ' favorable view of the U.S. is similar to the opinion of America voiced by the Germans ( 51 % ) and the Chinese ( 50 % ) and certainly more favorable than that held by the Russians ( 23 % ) and Pakistanis ( 14 % ) . But it trails the median view of the U.S. in the European Union ( 66 % ) and in other major emerging market economies : Brazil , South Africa and Indonesia . Moreover , nearly three-in-ten Indians voice no opinion about the United States — so the president has some salesmanship ahead .
Support for Obama is driving the vote of fewer Democrats today than in 2010 . In the current survey , 38 % of voters who plan to support the Democratic candidate in their district say they consider their vote as `` for '' Obama . Four years ago , far more Democratic voters ( 53 % ) said this .
Across 25 countries surveyed in 2018 , at least a plurality of respondents in nine nations have favorable views of both the U.S. and China . For example , around half of adults in Kenya , the Philippines and Nigeria give positive marks to China and to the U.S . These nine countries include traditional American allies like Israel and the United Kingdom , as well as some of China 's neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region , including Indonesia and Australia .
In his home country of Argentina , 91 % have a favorable opinion of Francis , including 65 % with a very favorable view . Majorities in every other Latin American country also see the pope in a positive light , including seven-in-ten or more in Colombia ( 83 % ) , Mexico ( 74 % ) , Brazil ( 74 % ) and Peru ( 72 % ) . Eight-in-ten or more also express support for the pope in Poland ( 92 % ) , Italy ( 91 % ) , France ( 88 % ) , Spain ( 84 % ) and Germany ( 82 % ) . A smaller portion , yet still a majority , in the United Kingdom ( 65 % ) view Francis favorably . Roughly half the Greeks ( 49 % ) agree , though nearly a quarter ( 24 % ) have an unfavorable view and about three-in-ten ( 28 % ) do not rate him . His favorability is lower in other regions , though many say they can not rate him , have never heard of him or do not have an opinion . In Asia , broad majorities in the Philippines ( 88 % ) and South Korea ( 86 % ) express positive views of Francis . At least four-in-ten give favorable views in Thailand ( 49 % ) , Bangladesh ( 47 % ) , Vietnam ( 41 % ) and Japan ( 40 % ) . But majorities in Indonesia ( 57 % ) , India ( 61 % ) , Malaysia ( 76 % ) and Pakistan ( 85 % ) do not have an opinion of the pope at all . A similar pattern arises in Africa . Majorities in Uganda ( 70 % ) , Tanzania ( 70 % ) and Kenya ( 56 % ) – countries with the highest percentages of Catholics in the African nations surveyed – give the pope a favorable rating . However , four-in-ten or more in Ghana ( 40 % ) , Nigeria ( 46 % ) , South Africa ( 52 % ) and Senegal ( 55 % ) , where more people tend to be Protestant or Muslim , offer no opinion . Many in the Middle East do not offer a rating of the pope . But of those who have an opinion , there are interesting differences between countries . Francis is most popular in Lebanon ( 62 % favorable ) , where more than a quarter of the population is Catholic . And half in Israel give the pope favorable marks . ( Pope Francis visited Israel and the Palestinian territories about two weeks after the survey was conducted . ) However , the pope receives his most negative ratings in Egypt ( 35 % unfavorable ) , Jordan ( 34 % ) and Turkey ( 32 % ) . Like many other countries with small Catholic populations , the pope is relatively unknown in Tunisia ( 71 % no rating ) and the Palestinian territories ( 63 % ) .
Seven-in-ten U.S. Mormons identify with the Republican Party or say they lean toward the GOP , compared with 19 % who identify as or lean Democratic – a difference of 51 percentage points . That 's the biggest gap in favor of the GOP out of 30 religious groups we analyzed , which include Protestant denominations , other religious groups and three categories of people who are religiously unaffiliated . At the other end of the spectrum , an overwhelming majority of members of the AME Church ( 92 % ) identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party , while just 4 % say they favor the Republican Party ( an 88-point gap ) . Similarly , 87 % of members of the National Baptist Convention and 75 % of members of the Church of God in Christ ( another historically black denomination ) identify as Democrats .
Just over two-in-ten ( 22 % ) say they followed events in Iraq very closely , while 7 % say they followed this news more closely than any other major story . News about Iraq and the most recent elections there accounted for 3 % of the newshole .
For example , those who see a more frequent impact of scientific findings on land use regulations also tend to be more upbeat about the state of science today ; 62 % say this is generally a good time for science . By comparison , those who say the best science guides land use regulations only some of the time or never are less positive . Half ( 50 % ) of this group says it is a good time and an equal share says it is a bad time for science overall . The same pattern holds for each of the four types of regulations considered in the survey . Scientists who perceive a more frequent influence of the best science on regulations are also more likely to say this is a good time for science compared with scientists who see less frequent impact of the best scientific information on policy rules .
Sharp growth in illegal immigration and increased enforcement of immigration laws have dramatically altered the ethnic composition of offenders sentenced in federal courts . In 2007 , Latinos accounted for 40 % of all sentenced federal offenders—more than triple their share ( 13 % ) of the total U.S. adult population . The share of all sentenced offenders who were Latino in 2007 was up from 24 % in 1991 , according to an analysis of data from the United States Sentencing Commission ( USSC ) by the Pew Hispanic Center , a project of the Pew Research Center . This heightened focus on immigration enforcement has also changed the citizenship profile of federal offenders . In 2007 , Latinos without U.S. citizenship represented 29 % of all federal offenders . Among all Latino offenders , some 72 % were not U.S. citizens , up from 61 % in 1991 . By contrast , a much smaller share of white offenders ( 8 % ) and black offenders ( 6 % ) who were sentenced in federal courts in 2007 were not U.S. citizens .2
Those who have a favorable opinion of populist parties in Germany and Sweden , for example , are only slightly less likely than those with unfavorable views to be upbeat about the economy . Roughly three-quarters ( 77 % ) of those who have a favorable opinion of the populist Alternative for Germany party ( AfD ) say their country 's economic situation is good ; that compares with 87 % among other Germans . Similarly , three-quarters of those with a positive view of the populist Sweden Democrats party say their country 's economic situation is good , compared with 91 % among other Swedes .
Americans are far more likely to say there are strong conflicts between Democrats and Republicans in U.S. society today than to say the same thing about blacks and whites , the rich and the poor , and other social groups . An overwhelming majority ( 86 % ) of Americans say conflicts between Democrats and Republicans are either strong or very strong , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . By comparison , 65 % of Americans see strong or very strong conflicts between blacks and whites , and 60 % see them between the rich and the poor . The share of Americans who say there are very strong conflicts between Democrats and Republicans ( 64 % ) is more than twice as large as the share who see very strong conflicts between blacks and whites ( 27 % ) , and between the rich and the poor ( 29 % ) . Americans are considerably less likely to see strong conflicts between two other sets of people : those who live in cities and those who live in rural areas , and those who are young and those who are older . Among U.S. adults , 37 % see strong or very strong conflicts between people in cities and people in rural areas ; a similar share ( 35 % ) see strong or very strong conflicts between young and older people . Most Americans either do n't see conflicts between these two groups of people or say the conflicts are not very strong .
First , at both a personal and societal level publics are generally more likely to say mobile phones have had a mostly good impact than to say the same of social media . A median of 70 % of adults across these 11 countries say mobile phones have been a mostly good thing for society , but that share falls to 57 % on the question of the impact of social media . Indeed , a median of 27 % think social media have been a mostly bad thing for society . Second , these publics are more likely to say that both mobile phones and social media have been mostly good for them personally than they are to say they have been mostly good for society . As noted above , an 11-country median of 70 % say that mobile phones have been mostly good for society . But an even larger share of 82 % say mobile phones have been mostly good for them personally . When it comes to social media , users of these sites are generally more likely to proclaim their benefits than non-users . Even among users , people 's views of their personal impact tend to be more positive than their views of their societal impact .
Both the American and German publics support cooperating more with a number of global powers in the future . Majorities across both nations want to work more with each other , as well as with France , Great Britain and China . However , fewer Germans want their country to cooperate more with the U.S. than with any other country tested . And roughly one-third in Germany ( 34 % ) say they want to cooperate less with the U.S. in the future . Almost eight-in-ten in Germany want to see their country working more with Russia . Americans are split – just 43 % want increased cooperation with Moscow while 44 % hold the opposite view . Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to say the U.S. should cooperate less with Russia in the future ( 55 % versus 35 % respectively ) . But when it comes to working with Germany , France , Great Britain and China , Democrats are more likely than Republicans to want increased cooperation .
According to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism , the media devoted the most newshole last week to the economy . Reporting on the nation 's troubled economy , including stories about the impact of President Obama 's proposed budget , made up 21 % of coverage . Reporting on the Toyota recalls accounted for 11 % of the newshole , while developments in Haiti made up another 8 % . Stories about potential changes to the nation 's policies on gays and lesbians in the military made up 4 % , while the Super Bowl accounted for 3 % of the newshole . The Tea Party convention made up just 1 % of the coverage examined .
Public support for trade and multinational corporations and the lack of enthusiasm for protesters does not mean that people necessarily reject critics ' concerns . Majorities , in most cases strong majorities , in 34 of 44 nations thought the availability of good paying jobs had gotten worse in the last five years . And substantial majorities–82 % in France , 67 % in the United States , 63 % in Mexico–thought the gap between the rich and the poor had worsened . But , unlike trade 's critics , the public did not blame globalization for these problems . People attributed such difficulties to domestic factors .
Online dating users are more likely to describe their overall experience with using dating sites or apps in positive , rather than negative , terms . Some 57 % of Americans who have ever used a dating site or app say their own personal experiences with these platforms have been very or somewhat positive . Still , about four-in-ten online daters ( 42 % ) describe their personal experience with dating sites or apps as at least somewhat negative .
While a median of 53 % across the same countries also see Iran playing a more important role , fewer in the region say that Israel and Saudi Arabia have gained influence in the past 10 years . The only country the surveyed publics see as less influential a decade on is Egypt .1
As China 's economy has grown , so too has its role in world affairs . An increasingly assertive China has challenged the geopolitical balance of power in Asia and extended its economic reach in Africa , Latin America , Europe and elsewhere . The Chinese people recognize their country 's growing prominence : 75 % say China is playing a more important role in world affairs than it did 10 years ago . Only 10 % of the Chinese believe that they are a less powerful player in the global arena .
Despite differences in views about a range of biomedical and physical science topics , both the public and scientists give relatively high marks to the nation 's scientific achievements and give distinctly lower marks to K-12 education in science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( known as STEM ) . Just 16 % of AAAS scientists and 29 % of adults in the general public considers K-12 STEM education in the U.S. to be the best or above average compared with other industrialized countries . Both groups see U.S. scientific achievements and medical treatment in a more positive light , by comparison .
There is widespread opposition to internet censorship in emerging and developing nations . Majorities in 22 of 24 countries surveyed say it is important that people have access to the internet without government censorship . In 12 nations , at least seven-in-ten hold this view . Opposition to government restrictions on the internet is especially common in several of the Latin American nations surveyed , including Venezuela , Chile , Argentina , Brazil , Mexico and Bolivia . It is also widespread in the Middle Eastern nations of Lebanon and Egypt .
Almost half ( 47 % ) of the public said military spending should be kept about the same , according to a survey conducted Oct. 30-Nov. 6 , 2013 . An additional 23 % said it should be increased while 28 % favored reductions . The findings reflect roughly the same sentiment found in a survey conducted a year ago . Almost equal numbers of Republicans ( 50 % ) and Democrats ( 47 % ) favored keeping military spending the same , but they differed sharply when it came to those who wanted to see increases or decreases . Nearly four-in-ten Democrats ( 39 % ) would cut the Pentagon budget compared with only 10 % of Republicans , while 37 % of Republicans would increase defense spending compared with 12 % of Democrats .
Among the roughly one-third of Millennials who affiliate with or lean toward the Republican Party , just 31 % have a mix of political values that are right-of-center , while about half ( 51 % ) take a mix of liberal and conservative positions and 18 % have consistently or mostly liberal views .
In its geopolitical rivalry with China , U.S. efforts to `` pivot '' to Asia – both economically and militarily – have general public support on both sides of the Pacific . Roughly half or more of the publics in seven of the nine nations surveyed that are involved in negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) trade and investment treaty , which is being pushed by the Obama administration , say such an accord would be good for their countries , though Americans are among the least supportive . Majorities or pluralities in five of eight TPP countries say it 's more important to have strong economic ties with the U.S. than China .
In 2015 , average hourly wages for black and Hispanic men were $ 15 and $ 14 , respectively , compared with $ 21 for white men . Only the hourly earnings of Asian men ( $ 24 ) outpaced those of white men . Among women across all races and ethnicities , hourly earnings lag behind those of white men and men in their own racial or ethnic group . But the hourly earnings of Asian and white women ( $ 18 and $ 17 , respectively ) are higher than those of black and Hispanic women ( $ 13 and $ 12 , respectively ) – and also higher than those of black and Hispanic men .
The survey also found wide differences between Trump and Clinton voters over how best to address the nation 's problems . Nearly two-thirds of voters overall ( 65 % ) – including an overwhelming share of Clinton supporters ( 84 % ) – said the more effective way to solve problems is with proven approaches that solve problems gradually , even if change may take a while . But Trump voters were divided on the best approach to solving problems in this country . About half ( 53 % ) favored `` new approaches that may solve problems quickly , but also risk making things worse . '' Conversely , 46 % of Trump backers preferred a proven , if slower , approach to problem-solving .
Americans by and large believe social media companies are censoring political viewpoints they find objectionable . Roughly three-quarters of Americans ( 73 % ) think it is very or somewhat likely that social media sites intentionally censor political viewpoints they find objectionable , including 37 % who say this is very likely . Larger shares in both parties think it 's likely that these sites engage in political censorship , but this belief is especially widespread among Republicans . Fully 90 % of Republicans say that social media sites intentionally censor political viewpoints that they find objectionable – with 60 % saying this is very likely the case . By comparison , fewer Democrats believe this to be very ( 19 % ) or somewhat ( 40 % ) likely . Republicans – but not Democrats – are divided along ideological lines on the issue . Conservative Republicans are far more likely than moderate or liberal Republicans to say it is very likely that social media sites intentionally censor political viewpoints they find objectionable ( 70 % vs. 44 % ) . Similar shares of moderate or conservative Democrats ( 20 % ) and liberal Democrats ( 18 % ) express this view .
The Fox News audience skews more ideological than that of its two main competitors . Fully 60 % of Fox News viewers describe themselves as conservative , compared with 23 % who say they are moderate and 10 % who are liberal , according to a 2012 survey by the Pew Research Center . By contrast , the ideological makeup of CNN viewers ( 32 % conservative , 30 % moderate , 30 % liberal ) and MSNBC viewers ( 32 % conservative , 23 % moderate , 36 % liberal ) is far more mixed .
However , no such age differential appears on the question of whether Muslims in France want either to be distinct from the larger culture or to adopt its customs . Nearly eight-in-ten French Muslims ( 78 % ) say they want to adopt French customs . Those under age 35 are equally as likely to say this as are their elders . This high preference for assimilation compares with that expressed by 53 % of Muslims in Spain , 41 % in Britain and 30 % in Germany .
This attitude manifests itself in differences between European and American Millennials ' views on what it takes to get ahead in life . For example , only about one-in-five French Millennials , one-in-four Greek Millennials and one-in-three Polish Millennials rate a good education as `` very important to getting ahead in life . '' By comparison , fully 58 % of Americans that age see education as strongly necessary for a successful future .
The number of physical assaults against Muslims in the United States reached 9/11-era levels last year , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new hate crimes statistics from the FBI . There were 91 reported aggravated or simple assaults motivated by anti-Muslim bias in 2015 , just two shy of the 93 reported in 2001 . Separately , the number of anti-Muslim intimidation crimes – defined as threatening bodily harm — also rose in 2015 , with 120 reported to the FBI . Again , this was the most anti-Muslim intimidation crimes reported in any year since 2001 , when there were 296 .
Turnout in the 2006 midterm election may well be higher than normal , given the level of interest expressed by voters . Today , 51 % of voters say they have given a lot of thought to this November 's election , up from 45 % at this point in 2002 and 42 % in early October of 1998 . Even in 1994 ­ a recent high in midterm election turnout ­ just 44 % of voters had thought a lot about the election in early October .
Around eight-in-ten Republican registered voters ( 79 % ) are Christians , compared with about half ( 52 % ) of Democratic voters . In turn , Democratic voters are much more likely than GOP voters to identify as religiously unaffiliated ( 38 % vs. 15 % ) .
With the news today that Japan 's 39-year-old Princess Kiko has given birth to a male heir , a succession crisis has apparently been averted . A 1947 law dictates that only a male can ascend to the Chrysanthemum Throne , but there had been no princes born to the royal family since 1965 , leading many to call for changing the law so a female — most likely four-year-old Princess Aiko — could eventually rule . The results of a recent Pew Global Attitudes survey show that the Japanese public was ready for just such a change : 76 % would have favored amending the Imperial Household Act to allow a female to take the throne .1
Fathers who are employed and at work cut back on the hours they spent on the job by a little more than mothers did . From September 2019 to September 2020 , the average weekly hours worked by fathers fell from 43.3 to 40.5 – nearly three hours per week . At the same time , mothers pared their average weekly hours from 36.8 to 35.0 , close to two hours per week . The change in work hours among mothers and fathers did not vary notably by the ages of the youngest children at home .
About two-thirds of Black ( 65 % ) and Hispanic voters ( 65 % ) said it is at least somewhat important to them to hear from the Trump and Biden campaigns . Among white voters , 55 % said this . Differences also emerge by age . About four-in-ten voters ages 65 and older ( 39 % ) said it is very important to them to hear from the presidential campaigns , compared with 30 % of those 50 to 64 , 20 % of those 30 to 49 and just 15 % of those ages 18 to 29 . Slightly more 18- to 29-year-old voters ( 37 % ) said it is somewhat important to them , compared with roughly three-in-ten saying the same in the other age groups .
Similar shares of adults younger than 30 express positive views of capitalism ( 52 % ) and socialism ( 50 % ) . Among older age groups , views of capitalism are more positive than opinions of socialism . Women are more likely than men to view socialism positively ( 46 % vs. 38 % ) , while a much larger share of men ( 74 % ) than women ( 56 % ) view capitalism positively . Nearly twice as many men as women have a very positive impression of capitalism ( 33 % vs. 17 % ) .
Women continue to bear a heavier burden when it comes to balancing work and family , despite progress in recent decades to bring about gender equality in the workplace . A 2013 Pew Research Center survey found that , among parents with at least some work experience , mothers with children under age 18 were about three times as likely as fathers to say that being a working parent made it harder for them to advance in their job or career ( 51 % vs. 16 % ) .
People around the globe identify ISIS and climate change as the leading threats to national security , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . The survey asked about eight possible threats . While the level and focus of concern varies by region and country , ISIS and climate change clearly emerge as the most frequently cited security risks across the 38 countries polled .
A Kaiser Health Tracking Poll conducted in October found that 65 % of Republicans would rather see their representative work to repeal and replace it compared with 33 % who favored keeping the law and working to improve it . By contrast , 86 % of Democrats want to see their representative work to improve the law while just 12 % favor scrapping it .
To be sure , the NRA has been an active voice in debates over many of these policy proposals . And the public is divided when it comes to the amount of influence the NRA has over guns laws in the U.S. : While 44 % of all adults say the NRA has too much influence over gun legislation , 40 % say it has the right amount of influence . Relatively few ( 15 % ) say the NRA has too little influence . For their part , NRA members are largely satisfied with the amount of influence the organization has over U.S. gun laws . About six-in-ten ( 63 % ) say the NRA has the right amount of influence and 28 % say it has too little influence . Only 9 % of NRA members say the organization has too much influence over gun laws . Among non-gun owners , 50 % view the NRA as too influential .
Registered voters who support Donald Trump are about twice as likely as registered voters who support Joe Biden to say that the news sources they turn to most often have reported made-up information that is intended to mislead the public ( 45 % vs. 22 % ) . They are also somewhat more likely to say their news sources have reported breaking information that has n't been fully verified ( 59 % vs. 50 % ) and factual information presented to favor one side of an issue ( 73 % vs. 64 % ) .
Americans are deeply divided politically on climate change and energy issues . Seventy-one percent of Democrats and independents who lean to the Democratic Party say Earth is getting warmer because of human activity , compared with 27 % of Republicans and independents who lean to the Republican Party . This finding is broadly consistent with other public polls and our previous research on climate change attitudes .
The problem of illegal drug use has receded somewhat from the national consciousness since the late 1980s and early 1990s , when there was massive media attention on the rise of crack cocaine and drug-related violence . Concern over drugs reached a peak in 1990 when 37 % of the public cited it as the top national problem .
Americans and Europeans do n't always agree on questions about morality , especially on issues related to sexuality . For instance , while just 30 % in the U.S. think sex between unmarried adults is morally unacceptable , this is nonetheless significantly higher than what our 2013 poll found in Europe . And while adultery is widely frowned upon in the EU – except , notably , in France – Americans are even more likely to say having an affair is morally unacceptable .
Average audience for the network TV Sunday morning political talk shows on ABC , CBS , Fox and NBC – This Week , Face the Nation , Fox News Sunday and Meet the Press , respectively – declined 8 % in 2018 , to about 2.3 million average viewers .
Trade and foreign investment engender both faith and skepticism around the world , according to a new Pew Research Center survey of 44 nations . Global publics , particularly in emerging and developing economies , agree that international commercial activity is a good thing . But not everyone is convinced , especially in advanced economies .
Those in every country surveyed worry about the impact of mobile phones on children . Across these 11 emerging economies , a median of 79 % of adults say people should be very concerned about children being exposed to harmful or immoral content when using their phones . In most countries , half or more say mobile phones and the internet have had a bad impact on children – more than the percentage who say they are concerned about the influence of technology on other facets of society included in the survey , such as politics , local culture and morality . While mobile phone users largely agree that their phones help them get news , many are concerned about the spread of misinformation when using their phone . A median of 79 % of mobile phone users across the 11 countries surveyed say their mobile phones have helped them get information and news about important issues . Smartphone users are particularly likely to say their devices bring these benefits compared with those with more basic devices . But , these perceived benefits can often coexist with concerns . A median of 64 % of adults also say people should be very concerned about exposure to false or incorrect information when using their mobile phones .
Fewer Americans voice confidence in Xi than say the same of leaders from other Asian nations , including Japan 's Shinzo Abe ( 61 % confidence ) and India 's Narendra Modi ( 42 % ) . However , many more think Xi will do the right thing regarding world affairs than North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , in whom a mere 9 % of Americans have confidence .
In the June 4 - 10 survey , a majority of voters said it is very ( 28 % ) or somewhat important ( 30 % ) to them personally to get messages from the presidential campaigns about important issues . About four-in-ten said it is not too important ( 25 % ) or not at all important ( 17 % ) .
About seven-in-ten Americans approve of direct talks with North Korea today ; in March of 2015 , shortly before the Iran agreement was reached , only about half of the public ( 49 % ) supported negotiating directly with Iran over its nuclear program . A larger share ( 63 % ) supported direct U.S. talks with Iran in 2009 .
Some owners try to be polite when addressing their smart speakers . More than half ( 54 % ) of smart speaker owners report that they ever say `` please '' when speaking to their device , including about one-in-five ( 19 % ) who say they do this frequently . And while the shares of Americans who say this tend to be similar across many groups , there are some notable differences by gender . Women are more likely than men to say they at least occasionally say `` please '' to their smart speaker ( 62 % vs. 45 % ) .
However , 29 % of LGBT adults also said they had been made to feel unwelcome in a church or other place of worship . Many also rated specific religious groups as unfriendly toward the LGBT community , including eight-in-ten ( 79 % ) who said the Catholic Church is unfriendly toward LGBT people .
In other news , about three-in-ten ( 31 % ) say they very closely followed the Iranian government 's crackdown on election protesters last week . That 's comparable to the 28 % that said they were following the post-election protests in Iran very closely one week earlier and indicates continued strong interest in the story . Close to two-in-ten ( 18 % ) say they followed developments in Iran more closely than any other story . A comparable share ( 29 % ) say they followed reports about the debate in Washington on health care reform very closely . About two-in-ten ( 19 % ) say they followed the health care debate more closely than any other major story . Those stories made up 7 % of coverage , according to PEJ .
Nearly two-thirds of Democrats ( 64 % ) say there would be fewer mass shootings in the U.S. if it were harder for people to legally obtain guns ; only about a quarter of Republicans ( 27 % ) say the same . And Republicans are skeptical that making it harder to legally obtain guns would have an effect on mass shootings : 54 % say it would not make a difference , while 18 % think restricting access to guns would lead to more mass shootings .
Although few Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19 themselves , many more say they know someone with a positive diagnosis . More than one-in-four U.S. adults ( 28 % ) say they personally know someone who has been diagnosed by a health care provider as having COVID-19 . A smaller share of Americans ( 20 % ) say they know someone who has been hospitalized or who has died as a result of having the coronavirus . Some groups are more likely than others to report personal experiences with COVID-19 . For instance , black adults are the most likely to personally know someone who has been hospitalized or died as a result of the disease . One-third of black Americans ( 34 % ) know someone who has been hospitalized or died , compared with 19 % of Hispanics and 18 % of white adults . Black Americans ( 32 % ) are also slightly more likely than Hispanic adults ( 26 % ) to know someone diagnosed with COVID-19 . Public health studies have found black Americans are disproportionately dying or requiring hospitalization as a result of the coronavirus . Areas in the northeastern United States have recorded some of the highest rates of coronavirus cases and fatalities , and this is reflected in the Center 's survey . About four-in-ten adults living in the Northeast ( 42 % ) say they personally know someone diagnosed with COVID-19 , significantly more than among adults living in any other region . People living in the Northeast ( 31 % ) are also the most likely to know someone who has been hospitalized or died as a result of the disease .
Not all Latinos are aware that the Obama administration has stepped up deportations of unauthorized immigrants . In response to a question on the Pew Hispanic survey , a plurality ( 41 % ) of Latinos say that the Obama administration is deporting more unauthorized immigrants than the Bush administration . Slightly more than a third ( 36 % ) say the two administrations have deported about the same number of immigrants . And one-in-ten ( 10 % ) Latinos say the Obama administration has deported fewer unauthorized immigrants than the Bush administration .
Public libraries , many Americans say , should offer programs to teach people digital skills ( 80 % think libraries should definitely do this ) and help patrons learn how to use new creative technologies like 3-D printers ( 50 % ) . At the same time , 57 % of Americans say libraries should definitely offer more comfortable places for reading , working and relaxing .
The share of births outside of marriage declined for immigrant women from 2008 to 2014 , but held steady for U.S.-born women . Immigrant women play an important role in overall U.S. fertility trends . Between 1970 and 2014 , the increase in the annual number of U.S. births was driven entirely by immigrant women , while births to U.S.-born women fell . The important role of immigrant women in driving U.S. births stems from both the growth in the foreign-born population and the fact that immigrant women have , on average , more children than U.S.-born women .
Over the past two decades , the share of students graduating from public high schools who are white and non-Hispanic has declined dramatically – from 73 % in 1995 to 57 % in 2012 , according to the most recent data available . In that time period the shares that are Hispanic and Asian have grown . WICHE projects that this trend will continue , with the public high school graduating class of 2025 being barely majority white ( 51 % ) .
The experiment found that respondents were more likely to say plenty of `` jobs '' were available in their community than they were to say plenty of `` good jobs '' were available ( 60 % vs. 48 % ) . While there are partisan differences in these views ( Republicans had more positive views of job availability ) , both Republicans and Democrats are significantly more likely to say `` jobs '' are available than to say `` good jobs '' are .
While Filipinos generally favor the pursuit of a less-tense relationship with China , the threat of conflict still exists , given the ongoing territorial disputes . In the event that a serious military conflict did occur between the Philippines and China , 68 % believe the U.S. would use military force to defend their country . Even among those who hold the U.S. in an unfavorable light , a majority ( 58 % ) believe that the U.S. would use military force to defend the Philippines . Meanwhile , a majority of Americans ( 58 % ) say that the U.S. should use military force to defend their Asian allies against China in the event of a serious conflict .
Overall views of immigrants : Views about immigration policies are often shaped by views about immigrants themselves : Are immigrants generally a problem , taking jobs and services , or do they strengthen the country through hard work and talents ? In our May survey , about half of Americans ( 51 % ) say immigrants strengthen the country , while 41 % view them as a burden . ( These opinions have fluctuated over the years , but in the mid-1990s , majorities said immigrants to the U.S. were a burden . ) However , Republicans ( 63 % ) are far more likely than Democrats ( 32 % ) to say immigrants are a burden . And the share of Republicans who regard immigrants as a burden jumped 15 percentage points , from 48 % in March 2014 .
When asked about the future of U.S.-European relations , nearly two-thirds of Americans say they would like relations to remain as close as they have been ( 65 % ) , while 30 % think the U.S. should take a more independent approach to foreign policy . However , when Germans were asked specifically about U.S.-German relations , roughly seven-in-ten ( 72 % ) said they would like their country to pursue a more independent approach .
3 More veterans say the military did a good job preparing them for life in the service than it did in readying them for the transition to civilian life . Veterans across eras offer similarly positive evaluations of the job the military did preparing them for military life , but less so when it comes to the return to civilian life . Roughly nine-in-ten veterans ( 91 % ) say the training they received when they first entered the military prepared them very or somewhat well for military life . By contrast , about half ( 52 % ) say the military prepared them very or somewhat well for the transition to civilian life .
Close to half ( 46 % ) say they have been following reports about the condition of the U.S. economy very closely ; 13 % say this was the one story they followed more closely than any other . Coverage of the economy – excluding reports on the financial regulation bill and unemployment benefits – made up 9 % of the newshole .
Majorities in all Western European countries surveyed in 2008 except Spain said they were very or fairly concerned that their country had become too dependent on Russia for its energy resources : Roughly six-in-ten or more among British ( 67 % ) , German ( 62 % ) and French ( 58 % ) publics expressed concern ; the Spanish public was evenly split on this issue ( 46 % concerned , 47 % not concerned ) . More than half in Poland ( 58 % ) and the Czech Republic ( 54 % ) offered critical opinions of Russia . And ratings of Russia were even worse among Western European publics . Majorities in France ( 65 % ) , Germany ( 62 % ) , and Sweden ( 59 % ) expressed an unfavorable view of Russia .
In 2012 , according to analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , more than 30 % of student-loan borrowers who moved into their repayment cycles were delinquent ( that is , they 're 90 days or more behind in their payments ) , up from 20 % just eight years earlier . That `` effective delinquency rate , '' which excludes people who are n't yet on the hook to start repaying their loans , has risen among all age groups but is highest among borrowers younger than 30 : 35 % of that subgroup was delinquent in 2012 .
Observers expect Hungarians to deliver a resounding `` no '' to accepting EU-mandated refugee quotas in a referendum Sunday . Through the course of a highly controversial campaign , Orbán has been criticized for referring to refugees as `` poison '' and supporting campaign ads linking refugees to terrorism . Such controversy has exacerbated tensions within the EU on Hungary 's adherence to European values of pluralism and liberal democracy . Despite the country 's labor shortage , Hungarians overwhelmingly see refugees as an economic albatross , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted this spring . Roughly eight-in-ten believe refugees are a burden on their country because they take jobs and social benefits . Similarly , about three-quarters believe that refugees will increase the likelihood of terrorism in Hungary , and about seven-in-ten see the large influx of refugees from countries like Syria and Iraq as a major threat . These figures are much higher in Hungary than in almost every other EU nation surveyed .
Increased cooperation with other countries is generally supported in both nations . In a Körber-Stiftung-sponsored survey fielded in Germany just before federal elections , people were asked whether Germany should cooperate more or less with various powers also included in Pew Research Center 's survey . Majorities said their country should cooperate more with each of these powers , but there were large variations in the strength of the responses . For example , nine-in-ten in Germany said the country should cooperate more with France . But only 56 % of Germans wanted to cooperate more with the U.S. , while about a third would cooperate less ( 34 % ) . When the Center asked the same question of Americans in October , majorities in the U.S. also said their country should cooperate more with Great Britain , France , Germany and China . But only 43 % of people in the U.S. say their country should cooperate more with Russia , while 44 % would cooperate less with the Kremlin . This is in stark contrast to opinion in Germany , where 78 % want to cooperate more with Moscow .
A majority of Republicans ( 60 % ) say Hamas is most responsible for the current violence . Democrats are divided : 29 % say Hamas is more responsible , 26 % Israel , while 18 % volunteer that both sides are responsible .
There are some modest demographic differences in how often Americans talk about the outbreak . Women are more likely than men ( 47 % vs. 41 % ) to say they talk about it most or almost all of the time , as are black adults ( 52 % ) when compared with Hispanic ( 46 % ) and white adults ( 42 % ) . Older people appear to be at higher risk from the virus , but they are less likely than younger Americans to talk about it frequently : Among those ages 65 and older , 38 % say they talk about it most or almost all of the time , lower than the shares in all other age groups . Education and partisan identification are also linked to how often Americans talk about the virus . Half of college graduates say they talk about it with others most or all of the time , but the share falls to 43 % among those with some college education and 39 % among those with a high school diploma or less .
Among posts that expressed this kind of confrontational rhetoric , 13 % of the reactions to the average post received `` angry '' feedback . By comparison , just 3 % of reactions for posts that did not express political opposition were angry . However , when it comes to the `` love '' reaction , there was no meaningful difference in the rates at which the congressional Facebook audience responded to confrontational posts ( about 4 % both for posts expressing opposition and for those not expressing opposition ) .
A June 2013 Global Attitudes survey found that nuclear proliferation in North Korea and Iran remain top priorities , as do Islamic extremist groups – over half of Americans rank each as a major threat to the United States . A second tier of threats that concern Americans includes China 's emergence as a world power , political instability in Pakistan and global climate change .
Among Russian adults , a survey we conducted last year showed that about half ( 53 % ) think Muslim extremist groups pose a major threat to their country . Russian Muslims – especially those living in the North Caucasus – share their non-Muslim compatriots ' concerns about extremism . In a 2011 - 2012 Pew Research survey , nearly half of Russian Muslims said they were either very concerned ( 20 % ) or somewhat concerned ( 27 % ) about religious extremism in their country , including more than half of Muslims in the North Caucasus ( 33 % very concerned , 25 % somewhat concerned ) . The same survey revealed that the vast majority of Russia 's Muslims ( 86 % ) reject the use of violence against civilians in defense of Islam .
Two-thirds ( 66 % ) of Americans say that European companies building factories in the United States will mostly help the U.S. economy . Men ( 71 % ) more than women ( 62 % ) support such greenfield investment . And , there is strong support for it among Americans with at least a college degree ( 84 % ) . A smaller proportion of Germans , roughly half ( 49 % ) , express the view that American firms building plants in Germany will benefit the local economy . Men ( 55 % ) are more supportive than women ( 43 % ) , as are Germans age 18 to 29 ( 55 % ) compared with people 50 years of age and older ( 44 % ) . German ambivalence about such new U.S. investment may stem from a distrust of American business practices . A 2012 Pew Research Center survey found that nearly two-thirds of Germans ( 65 % ) disliked American ways of doing business .
While the journalism world conferred its top honor yesterday to the newspapers that reported on Edward Snowden 's National Security Agency leaks , the public remains divided over whether those classified leaks served the public interest . In the recent survey , attitudes about the leaks varied by age . Adults ages 18 - 29 are more likely to say the leaks helped the public ( 57 % ) than hurt it ( 35 % ) . Adults 30 - 49 are somewhat split , while those ages 50 and older are more likely to say the leaks harmed than helped the public .
While it is fairly common for social media users to come across other people posting things about their love lives , only a minority of Americans who use these platforms ( 28 % ) say they have ever shared or discussed things about their relationship or dating life . About four-in-ten adults who are living with their partner ( 39 % ) and nearly half of those in a committed relationship ( 48 % ) but not living together say they have ever posted about their relationship on social media . Conversely , married and single adults are the least likely to post about their love lives ( 24 % and 26 % , respectively ) .
Pew Research Center has been tracking Americans ' internet behavior for years , all the while focusing on personal use from any location . While our approach has evolved over time , the current measurement consists of two questions : `` Do you use the internet or email , at least occasionally ? '' and `` Do you access the internet on a cellphone , tablet or other mobile handheld device , at least occasionally ? '' In a January 2018 phone survey , 89 % of U.S. adults said `` yes '' to at least one of these questions .
Comparable proportions of Democrats who are college graduates ( 88 % ) and those with less education ( 82 % ) say that there is solid evidence that the earth is getting warmer . Among Democrats , higher education is associated with the belief that global warming is mostly caused by human activity . Fully 75 % of Democrats with college degrees say that the earth is warming and that this is caused by human activity . Just 52 % of Democrats with less education express this view . Among Republicans , similar percentages of college graduates and those with less education say there is solid evidence of global warming ( 46 % and 51 % , respectively ) . Yet for Republicans , unlike Democrats , higher education is associated with greater skepticism that human activity is causing global warming . Only 19 % of Republican college graduates say that there is solid evidence that the earth is warming and it is caused by human activity , while 31 % of Republicans with less education say the same .
The sharpest falloff during that period came among moderate and liberal Republicans . Just 27 % of moderates and liberals expressed a favorable view , down 19 points from the previous June . The Tea Party 's ratings declined even among conservatives , from 74 % favorable in June of that year to 65 % in October .
When friendships end , many teens take steps to cut the digital web that connects them to their former friend . Girls who use social media or cellphones are more likely to prune old content and connections : 53 % of social media- or cellphone-using girls have blocked someone after ending a friendship , compared with 37 % of boys .
When asked specifically about Kashmir , a majority of Indians ( 55 % ) see the situation there as a very big problem . More than half ( 53 % ) say circumstances in Kashmir have gotten worse over the last five years , and a majority ( 58 % ) believes the Indian government should use more military force than it uses currently in dealing with tensions in the area .
Foreign policy : Defending the country against terrorism remains one of the public 's top policy priorities . A majority of Americans ( 67 % ) say terrorism should be a top priority this year , though this differs greatly by party . Looking at foreign conflicts , the U.S. public is divided over whether withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria is the right ( 43 % ) or wrong ( 45 % ) decision . Many Americans ( 65 % ) do not think Trump has a clear plan for dealing with the situation in Syria ; this includes a majority of Republicans ( 56 % ) and an even larger majority of Democrats ( 91 % ) .
While 59 % of Millennials describe the members of their generation as self-absorbed , 49 % say they are wasteful and 43 % describe them as greedy . On all three dimensions , Millennials are significantly more critical of their generation than older age cohorts are of theirs . And while Silents are more likely than other generations to say that several positive terms describe their generation , they also are less likely to say some negative terms apply . Only about one-in-ten Silents see the people of their generation as self-absorbed ( 7 % ) , wasteful ( 10 % ) and greedy ( 8 % ) – by far the lowest shares of any cohort . There are smaller differences among generations over whether the term `` cynical '' describes people in their age cohort : 31 % of Millennials say it applies , compared with 24 % of Gen X , 16 % of Boomers and just 7 % of Silents . Relatively few across all generations – only about one-in-ten – say the term `` rigid '' applies .
Teens say anxiety and depression are a major problem among their peers . Seven-in-ten U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 said in a 2018 survey that anxiety and depression were a major problem among people their age in the community where they live – a pattern that does not vary substantially by household income . When asked about their own lives , a majority of teens ( 61 % ) said they face a lot of pressure to get good grades in school . About three-in-ten said they feel tense or nervous about their day almost daily , and the same share wished they had more friends .
4 Americans have long argued about whether nativity scenes and other religious holiday displays on public property violate the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution 's First Amendment . In the 1980s , the Supreme Court handed down two landmark rulings that allow for displays of Christmas crèches , Hanukkah menorah and other religious holiday symbols on public property so long as they do not actively endorse or promote a particular religion or religion in general . In practice , religious symbols that are a part of larger secular holiday display ( containing , say , Christmas trees , Santa Claus and reindeer ) have had a much better chance of surviving a court challenge than those displays that are solely or more overtly religious . 5 Most Americans believe that elements of the biblical Christmas story reflect actual historical events , although the percentage expressing this view has dropped noticeably in recent years . Two-thirds ( 66 % ) say Jesus was born to a virgin , compared with 73 % who said this in 2014 ; 75 % believe he was laid in a manger , down from 81 % . Similarly , the shares who say they believe that wise men , guided by a star , brought Jesus gifts — and that an angel appeared to shepherds to announce the birth of Jesus — also have declined . A slim majority of U.S. adults ( 57 % ) believe that all four of these things actually happened , down from 65 % three years ago . Belief in these events has declined not only among people with no religious affiliation , but among Christians as well . Overall , about one-in-five Americans ( 19 % ) now say none of these things actually happened .
Looking at voters ' priorities for immigration policy , there is some common ground among partisans . When asked whether the policy priority should be `` creating a way for immigrants already here illegally to become citizens if they meet certain requirements , '' or `` better border security and stronger enforcement of our immigration laws '' – or whether both should be given equal priority – nearly half of Republican voters ( 48 % ) and about as many Democratic voters ( 45 % ) say both should be given equal priority .
A number of congressional districts in the South saw the fastest growth of Latino eligible voters in the country . North Carolina 's 8th District saw the nation 's largest increase ( 163.2 % ) in Latino eligible voters between 2014 and 2017 . The next five districts with the largest growth during this time are Florida 's 6th ( up 110.3 % ) , North Carolina 's 5th ( 71.3 % ) and Florida 's 16th ( 70.5 % ) .
Still , Republican men do stand out . Just 45 % of Republican men say online harassment is a major problem , compared with around six-in-ten or more Republican women , Democratic men and Democratic women . And Republican men are also less likely than Republican women , Democratic men and Democratic women to say offensive content online is too often excused as not a big deal and to prioritize creating safe and welcoming online environments .
Caregivers are highly engaged in the pursuit of health information , support , care , and advice , both online and offline , and do many health-related activities at higher levels than non-caregivers . Indeed , being a caregiver is independently associated with key health-related activities . When controlling for age , income , education , ethnicity , and good overall health , caregivers are more likely than other adults to :
The partisan gap is similar among White adults . About nine-in-ten White Democrats ( 88 % ) express at least some support for the Black Lives Matter movement , compared with 16 % of White Republicans . And while about half of White Democrats ( 51 % ) say they strongly support the movement , just 2 % of White Republicans say the same .
Japan has a median age of 48 – more than 17 years above the global figure – and about a third of its inhabitants ( 34 % ) are 60 or older . In South Korea , another economically advanced country , the median age is 44 and nearly a quarter of the population ( 23 % ) is 60 or older . Both countries have very low fertility and unusually high life expectancies . And even though both countries have recently reported a `` second wave '' of coronavirus cases , the fatality rates there so far have been relatively low .
A 20-public median of 48 % say genetically modified , or GM , foods are unsafe to eat , while a much smaller median of 13 % say GM foods are safe . The survey included an option for people with limited familiarity about GM foods to indicate this ; a median of 37 % say they do n't know enough to offer a view about the safety of GM foods . Majorities in places such as Russia ( 70 % ) , Italy ( 62 % ) , India ( 58 % ) and South Korea ( 57 % ) view GM foods as generally unsafe to eat . The balance of opinion tilts negative even in places where sizable shares say they do n't know enough about GM foods to offer a view . For example , 47 % of Spaniards say GM foods are unsafe , while just 13 % say they are safe to eat . Australia is the only place surveyed where at least as many view GM foods as safe as view them to be unsafe ( 31 % to 31 % ) .
Libertarianism is associated with limited government involvement in the social sphere . In this regard , self-described libertarians are somewhat more supportive of legalizing marijuana than the public overall ( 65 % vs. 54 % ) . But there are only slight differences between libertarians and the public in views of the acceptability of homosexuality . And they are about as likely as others to favor allowing the police `` to stop and search anyone who fits the general description of a crime suspect '' ( 42 % of libertarians , 41 % of the public ) .
Among Europeans , there is a wide range of opinion on whether the government can prevent statements that are offensive to minorities . Seven-in-ten Germans say this should be the case ( where there are clear laws against hate speech ) , as do 62 % of Italians and half of Poles . The French are divided , with 48 % saying that the government should have the ability to prevent speech that is offensive to minority groups , while 51 % say people should be able to say these things publicly . In contrast , the balance of opinion in the UK and Spain is to allow people to say statements that might offend minorities .
Even though mobile technology often simplifies the completion of everyday tasks , cell phone owners can also encounter technical glitches and unwanted intrusions on their phones . In an April 2012 survey , the Pew Research Center 's Internet & American Life Project assessed the prevalence of four problems that cell owners might face . Some 55 % of cell phone owners say they use their phones to go online— to browse the internet , exchange emails , or download apps . We asked them if they experience slow download speeds that prevent things from loading as quickly as they would like :
On a question about morality , Hispanic teens hold different opinions from their White , non-Hispanic peers . Hispanic teens are about evenly split on the question of whether it is necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values : 50 % say it is not necessary , while 48 % say it is . By comparison , 71 % of White teens say that a belief in God is unnecessary to be moral and 28 % say it is necessary .
This anger plays a large role in the high level of enthusiasm among Democratic voters . Fully 71 % of Democratic voters who describe themselves as `` angry '' at government say they are more enthusiastic about voting this year , compared with 45 % of those who are `` frustrated '' or `` basically content '' with government . Similarly , Democrats who register strong disapproval of the president are far more likely to be eager to vote than those with less strong views ( 58 % vs. 29 % enthusiastic ) . And 56 % of Democrats who say their congressional vote is a vote against the president express high enthusiasm about 2006 , compared with just 44 % who say Bush is not a factor in their vote .
Clear majorities of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic say that , regardless of religious objections , those providing wedding services should treat same-sex couples the same as other customers ( 67 % ) , and that transgender people should be able to use facilities for the gender with which they currently identify ( 68 % ) . In contrast , similar-sized majorities of Republicans and Republican leaners say that wedding-related business owners should be able to refuse service to same-sex couples on religious grounds ( 71 % ) , and that transgender people should be required to use the public restrooms of the gender they were assigned at birth ( 67 % ) .
While some of the recommendations of the Verma Committee were implemented in March 2013 , the public remains dissatisfied with the current laws and the police 's handling of rape cases , with roughly three-in-four saying that the current criminal code for dealing with such cases is too lax . Fewer than one-in-ten Indians rate the current laws as `` about right '' in dealing with cases of rape ( 7 % ) . And only 6 % of the public says that the police investigate these cases adequately . Meanwhile , 18 % think that laws on rape are too tough , while 15 % hold this view about law enforcement .
Overall , 43 % of U.S. adults say that law enforcement does not take incidents of online harassment seriously enough . Another 19 % feel that police do take harassment complaints seriously , and 32 % are unsure of how law enforcement handles this issue .
Agreement on proposed solutions , though , did not share the ubiquity of concern about the size of the deficit . A poll in the summer of 1983 found overwhelming disapproval for raising taxes ( 78 % disapprove , 15 % approve ) and making cuts to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare ( 82 % disapprove , 11 % approve ) in order to address the deficit . By lesser margins , Americans also rejected further cuts to social programs ( 50 % disapprove , 42 % approve ) as a solution . With the Cold War front and center during the Reagan years , the public nevertheless gave its strongest support for any deficit-cutting proposal to cuts in defense spending ( 55 % approve , 35 % disapprove ) .
There were wide differences in voting preferences between men and women , whites and nonwhites , as well as people with more and less educational attainment . The gender gap in voting preference is not new , but it is at least as wide as at any point over the past two decades , according to exit polls by the National Election Pool , as reported by CNN . Women favored the Democratic candidate in their district by 19 percentage points ( 59 % to 40 % ) while men voted for the Republican 51 % to 47 % . ( The exit polls offer the first look at the electorate ; the portrait will be refined over time as additional data , such as state voter files , become available ) .
In terms of broader priorities for the nation 's energy supply , a majority of Americans ( 58 % ) say it is more important to develop alternative energy sources , such as wind , solar and hydrogen technology , while just 34 % say expanding exploration and production of oil , coal and natural gas is the more important priority . These views are little changed from February , when 54 % said more important to develop alternatives and 34 % said more important to expand production from traditional sources .
Immigrant and second-generation self-identified Hispanics ( 57 % and 50 % respectively ) are most likely to say their parents talked often about their pride in their country of origin roots . But by the third generation , only 33 % say their parents talked often about their pride in their roots while growing up .
Likewise , most adults in Taiwan would welcome closer political ties with the United States . Nearly eight-in-ten overall support more Taipei-Washington political interactions , and at least seven-in-ten or more in each of the groups analyzed say they would favor more bilateral political relations . The highest level of enthusiasm for this comes from those who support the DPP ( 91 % ) , those who identify solely as Taiwanese ( 84 % ) and those ages 18 to 29 ( 82 % ) .
Even as many YouTube users say the site plays an important role in helping them navigate various aspects of their lives , it can also be a space where they encounter troubling or problematic content . Around two-thirds of users ( 64 % ) say they at least sometimes encounter videos that seem obviously false or untrue while using the site . A similar share ( 60 % ) say they at least sometimes encounter videos that show people engaging in dangerous or troubling behavior . A minority of users also say they see videos that are abusive or demeaning toward others – and 11 % say they see this type of content frequently .
Currently , there are modest differences in outlook by levels of educational attainment . Those with some college experience are somewhat less likely to say they have a lot of confidence in the future of the U.S. than are both those with more and less education . The shares who say they have a lot of confidence are down significantly since 2015 among postgraduates ( 13 points ) , college graduates ( 8 points ) and those with some college experience ( 7 points ) . There has been no significant shift in outlook among those with no more than a high school diploma .
Most Americans also have at least a fair amount of confidence in medical scientists and scientists to act in the best interest of the public . Some 84 % of U.S. adults express confidence in medical scientists ; 24 % say they have a great deal of confidence and six-in-ten ( 60 % ) have a fair amount of confidence in medical scientists to act in the public 's best interests . Three-quarters of Americans ( 76 % ) have either a great deal ( 21 % ) or a fair amount of confidence ( 55 % ) in scientists , generally , to act in the public interest . Confidence in either group is about the same or only modestly different across party and ideological groups .
Only 23 % of U.S. adults who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino have heard of the term Latinx , and just 3 % say they use it to describe themselves , according to a bilingual survey of U.S. Hispanic adults the Center conducted in December 2019 . Awareness and use vary across subgroups , with young Hispanics ages 18 to 29 among the most likely to have heard of the term – 42 % say they have heard of it , compared with 7 % of those ages 65 or older . Use is among the highest for Hispanic women ages 18 to 29 – 14 % say they use it , compared with 1 % of Hispanic men in the same age group who say they use it .
To determine the specific kinds of occupations with the most growth potential , we combined the job preparation and skill ratings the Center developed for its report with the projections from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' Occupational Outlook Handbook . Ratings and projections were available for 541 separate occupations , in 24 different sectors spanning the U.S. civilian workforce . All together , they cover nearly 149 million jobs , or virtually the entire workforce . ( More than 7 million Americans , according to the BLS , work more than one job . ) If we consider the BLS 's full set of employment projections ( which includes 30 or so `` catchall '' occupations covering an additional 1.5 million jobs ) , the strongest growth is foreseen for operations research analysts , statisticians , actuaries and other mathematics-oriented jobs : Employment in math occupations is expected to grow by 28 % , though that 's off a fairly small base ( the group had only 152,400 jobs in 2014 ) . Health care ( 18.6 % ) , personal care and service ( 13.1 % ) and computer and information technology ( 12.5 % ) were the other employment sectors with particularly fast projected growth . On the other hand , employment in production occupations is expected to fall by 3.1 % by 2024 ( representing more than 282,000 jobs ) , and employment in farming , fishing and forestry occupations is projected to shrink by 5.9 % .
But it is also likely that the language and context of the question are substantial factors . Where the first three polls said the DOJ subpoenaed , obtained through a court order , or secretly collected the phone records , the Fox News question used the phrase secretly seized to describe the DOJ 's actions . The Fox News survey also pointed out that the records were extensive , included both work and personal phones , and that they did so without giving the news organization prior notice , as is customary . By two-to-one ( 60 % vs. 31 % ) more said this action by the government went too far rather than was probably justified . An additional factor that likely affected the responses to the Fox News question was the context in which it was presented . Immediately prior to asking about the legitimacy of the DOJ 's actions , Fox News asked : Does it feel like the federal government has gotten out of control and is threatening the basic civil liberties of Americans , or does n't it feel this way to you ? There is a long track record in the survey industry of how framing a question in a particular context can affect responses , and there is little doubt that raising this broad criticism of government – which roughly two-thirds ( 68 % ) of respondents agreed with – prior to the DOJ question had some effect .
One-in-five Americans are expected to be 65 and older by mid-century , and this could be a problem for the country . There is worry that government and household finances may be pushed to the brink by rising pension and health care expenditures . Economic growth , we are warned , might suffer with fewer workers and more retirees . But what does the public think ?
Politically , people also tend to see a trade-off between the two superpowers . About half of adults in Taiwan ( 49 % ) would support closer political ties to the U.S. but would not say the same of mainland China . Adults who prefer political ties to the U.S. over ties to the mainland are more likely to be ages 18 to 29 , support the currently ruling DPP or identify solely as Taiwanese . No more than about one-in-ten reject closer political ties to both countries or support closer political ties with China but not the U.S .
Most Hispanic adults see being Hispanic as part of their racial background . While being Hispanic is described on census survey forms as an ethnic origin and not a race , two-thirds of Hispanic adults said in the 2015 survey that being Hispanic was part of their racial background , including 11 % who described it only as their race and 56 % who said it was part of both their racial and ethnic background ; 19 % said being Hispanic was part of their ethnic background only .
As in the past , there are wide religious differences in Middle East sympathies . White evangelical Protestants continue to overwhelmingly sympathize with Israel : 78 % say this , while just 5 % sympathize more with the Palestinians . Other religious groups sympathize more with Israel than the Palestinians , though by much smaller margins . Religiously unaffiliated people are divided : 29 % sympathize more with the Palestinians , 26 % more with Israel and 24 % say they side with both or neither .
Republicans have widened their lead in leaned party identification among white evangelical Protestants : About two-thirds ( 68 % ) of white evangelicals lean Republican , while just 22 % lean Democratic . The GOP also holds a substantial advantage among Mormons . Fully 70 % of Mormons lean Republican , while just 22 % lean Democratic .
By their own reckoning , Latinos1 living in the United States do not have a national leader . When asked in an open-ended question to name the person they consider `` the most important Latino leader in the country today , '' nearly two-thirds ( 64 % ) of Hispanic respondents said they did not know . An additional 10 % said `` no one . ''
A subsequent survey in summer 2019 found widespread discontent on a number of other questions . Around two-thirds or more of Lebanese adults said they are pessimistic about the future of their country 's political system ( 76 % ) ; disagree that the government is run for the benefit of all people ( 72 % ) ; are dissatisfied with how their country 's democracy is working ( 67 % ) ; and do not think most elected officials in their country care what people like them think ( 66 % ) .
Broad public recognition of China 's growing pains notwithstanding , the polling found broad acceptance of China 's transformation from a socialist to a capitalist society . Seven-in-ten say people are better off in a free market economy , even though this means some may be rich while others are poor . This sentiment is true across demographic groups , and even those in the low-income category believe in the benefits of the free market system . The social changes in Chinese society that have accompanied the transformation and growth of the economy get a somewhat mixed review . On the one hand , about seven-in-ten ( 71 % ) say they like the pace of modern life . But on the other , many worry about vanishing traditions – 59 % believe their traditional way of life is getting lost , while just 37 % say these traditions remain strong .
A majority of Israelis ( 61 % ) approve of Netanyahu 's policies toward the U.S. , while 28 % disapprove . Israeli Jews who describe themselves as traditional , religious or ultra-orthodox are especially likely to approve of Netanyahu 's policies ( 75 % approve ) , but most secular Jews also approve ( 63 % ) . Israeli Arabs are more critical of the prime minister 's policies toward the U.S. ; just 22 % approve and 59 % disapprove of Netanyahu 's policies toward the U.S . In the Palestinian territories , half approve of Abbas ' policies toward the U.S. , and 38 % disapprove . Views of the way Hamas is handling the U.S. are more mixed ; 39 % approve and 46 % disapprove . Opinions about Hamas ' policies toward the U.S. are similar in the West Bank and Gaza .
As the Obama administration announces new economic measures against Russian officials and companies , the public supports increased U.S. economic and diplomatic sanctions by a 53 % to 36 % margin . But by roughly two-to-one ( 62 % to 30 % ) , Americans oppose sending arms and military supplies to the Ukrainian government .
The public has grown more supportive of the U.S. fight against ISIS , as about twice as many approve ( 63 % ) as disapprove ( 30 % ) of the military campaign against the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria . Last October , 57 % approved and 33 % disapproved . The possibility of sending U.S. ground troops to the region is more divisive , although the idea draws more support than it did four months ago . Currently , about as many favor ( 47 % ) as oppose ( 49 % ) sending U.S. ground troops to fight Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria ; in October , 39 % favored the idea and 55 % opposed it .
A new Pew Research Center analysis finds that 66 % of Americans own at least two digital devices – smartphone , desktop or laptop computer , or tablet – and 36 % own all three . The age group most likely to own multiple devices is 30- to 49-year-olds , half of whom report owning all three , according to our 2015 survey data .
Among Republicans and Republican leaners , a wide majority of those with household incomes of $ 75,000 a year or more ( 73 % ) think lowering taxes on corporations and large businesses would help the economy . By comparison , 42 % of Republicans in households making $ 30,000 a year or less think lower taxes for large businesses and corporations would help the economy . Among Democrats and Democratic leaners , the income pattern in views is the reverse : Those with higher incomes are more likely than those with lower incomes to say tax cuts for large businesses and corporations would hurt the economy . About six-in-ten Democrats with incomes of $ 75,000 a year or more ( 61 % ) think lowering taxes on corporations would hurt the economy , compared with 44 % of those earning $ 30,000 a year or less . While Democrats overall think lower taxes on large businesses and corporations would make the tax system less fair , this view is more widely held among those earning $ 75,000 a year or more ( 76 % ) and those earning between $ 30,000 and $ 74,999 ( 61 % ) than among those with household incomes of less than $ 30,000 ( 45 % ) . Among Republicans , those with incomes of $ 75,000 a year or above are more likely to say lowering taxes on large businesses and corporations would make the tax system more fair ( 43 % ) than less fair ( 17 % ) .
A major concern about immigration among people in the countries surveyed is whether immigrants will make the effort to integrate into their new country . In a late 2017 Pew Research Center survey , majorities in all countries agreed that , for the good of their society , immigrants should adopt the country 's customs and traditions .
Americans have different views about where it is and is n't appropriate to use a cellphone . In a 2014 Pew Research Center survey , roughly three-quarters of adults said it was OK for people to use their phones while walking down the street , riding public transit or waiting in line , but far fewer found it acceptable to use cellphones during a meeting , at the movies or in church .
An estimated 679,000 Hispanics of Peruvian origin lived in the United States in 2017 , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey . Peruvians in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Peruvian origin ; this includes immigrants from Peru and those who trace their family ancestry to Peru . Peruvians are the 11th-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States , accounting for about 1 % of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017 . Since 2000 , the Peruvian-origin population has increased 174 % , growing from 248,000 to 679,000 over the period . At the same time , the Peruvian foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 120 % , from 193,000 in 2000 to 423,000 in 2017 . By comparison , Mexicans , the nation 's largest Hispanic origin group , constituted 36.6 million , or 62 % , of the Hispanic population in 2017 .
As Americans prepare for Thanksgiving , most U.S. adults ( 59 % ) say their family is OK with talking about politics , while 40 % say they try to avoid the subject . But the willingness of families to engage in political talk is tied to their level of political agreement , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Nov. 7 - 13 , 2018 .
The rise in unfavorable views comes amid widespread criticism over how China has handled the coronavirus pandemic . Across the 14 nations surveyed , a median of 61 % say China has done a bad job dealing with the outbreak . This is many more than say the same of the way the COVID-19 pandemic was handled by their own country or by international organizations like the World Health Organization or the European Union . Only the U.S. receives more negative evaluations from the surveyed publics , with a median of 84 % saying the U.S. has handled the coronavirus outbreak poorly .
Yet there is broad public skepticism that a thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations will lead to greater democracy in Cuba . Only about a third ( 32 % ) say they think Cuba will become more democratic over the next several years , while 60 % say it will be about the same as it is now .
About three-in-ten ( 29 % ) say they were following news about the terrorist shootings in Paris very closely , according to a separate survey conducted Jan. 8 - 11 among 1,000 adults . That compares with 24 % who were very closely following news about the U.S. economy , 19 % who tracked the AirAsia flight that crashed Dec. 29 , and 17 % who paid close attention to news about the incoming Republican leaders in Congress . While younger Americans typically pay less attention to news events than older Americans , the gap on the terrorist shootings in Paris is particularly large : 43 % of those ages 65 and older followed this news very closely , while just 15 % of those ages 18 - 29 say they did the same .
The character of the person who occupies the Oval Office matters to the vast majority of Americans . Across party lines and religious groups , roughly nine-in-ten or more say it is either somewhat or very important to have a president who lives a moral , ethical life . But Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party are more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say it is `` very '' important ( 71 % vs. 53 % ) , according to a recent Pew Research Center survey . Fewer Americans ( 52 % ) say it 's either somewhat ( 32 % ) or very ( 20 % ) important for a president to have strong religious beliefs , even if those beliefs are different from their own . But Republicans place more of a premium on having a president who is religious : About two-thirds of Republicans ( 65 % ) say this trait is at least somewhat important , compared with four-in-ten Democrats who say this ( 41 % ) .
A substantial majority of Americans ( 76 % ) feel that both spending cuts and tax increases should be a part of the next step in tackling the federal budget deficit . But an equally large proportion believes that the greater share should come from spending cuts , even if tax hikes are also considered .
YouTube is the second-largest social networking site , behind Facebook . A 2014 Pew Research Center study of online adults found that three-quarters ( 77 % ) of internet users are on Facebook , while 63 % use YouTube . Although YouTube has a smaller reach than Facebook , it is more widely used than LinkedIn ( 25 % ) , Google Plus ( 24 % ) and Twitter ( 21 % ) .
Four decades after the birth of Louise Brown , the first `` test-tube baby '' conceived via in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , 33 % of American adults report that they or someone they know has used some type of fertility treatment in order to try to have a baby , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . The share of people who say they have undergone a fertility treatment or know someone who has varies markedly by education and income . About four-in-ten ( 43 % ) of those with a bachelor 's degree have had some exposure to fertility treatment – either through their own experience or that of someone they know – and the share rises to 56 % among those with a postgraduate degree . About half ( 48 % ) of people with family incomes of $ 75,000 or more also have been exposed to fertility treatment . ( The survey did not specify what type of treatment . ) Whites are more likely than blacks or Hispanics to report that they have undergone a fertility treatment or know someone who has ( 37 % vs. 22 % and 26 % , respectively ) , and women are more likely than men to say the same ( 36 % vs. 30 % ) .
Earlier surveys by Pew Research Center show that many Americans see the creation and spread of made-up news and information as a considerable problem . In an early 2019 survey , 50 % of U.S. adults said made-up news and information was a very big problem in the country today – a larger share than said the same about issues including racism , illegal immigration , terrorism and sexism . Around half or more also said made-up news has a big impact on political leaders ' ability to get work done ( 51 % ) , Americans ' confidence in each other ( 54 % ) and their confidence in the government ( 68 % ) .
With a higher U.S.-born share comes a larger share who are proficient in English . About three-quarters of Hispanic Millennials are proficient English speakers – that is , they either speak only English at home ( 28 % ) or speak a language other than English at home , but speak English `` very well '' ( 48 % ) . Some 19 % of Hispanic Millennials speak English less than very well and just 5 % do not speak English at all .
A few months later , a Harris poll got a sense of how homosexuals were viewed by the public by asking whether homosexuals ( and many other groups ) were `` more helpful '' or `` more harmful '' to American life . By a margin of 63 % to 1 % , Americans said homosexuals were more harmful than helpful ; 25 % said homosexuals neither helped nor harmed and 10 % were not sure . This balance of opinion at the time put homosexuals in similar esteem as prostitutes and atheists – although not as negatively viewed as Americans who were members of the Communist Party . Among other groups , civil rights demonstrators recorded 25 % support as being more helpful , but a 60 % majority said they were more harmful . ( For reference , among the full list of 18 types of people , `` young people who spend most of their time reading books '' had the most positive ratings , 48 % to 8 % . )
Americans are divided over whether restricting legal gun ownership would lead to fewer mass shootings . Debates over the nation 's gun laws have often followed recent mass shootings . But Americans are split over whether legal changes would lead to fewer mass shootings , according to a fall 2018 poll . Nearly half of adults ( 47 % ) say there would be fewer mass shootings if it was harder for people to obtain guns legally , while a similar share ( 46 % ) says there would be no difference . Very few ( 6 % ) say there would be more mass shootings if it was harder for people to obtain guns legally .
A majority of Americans who are focused on living in ways that protect the environment say it bothers them `` a lot '' when they see other people leave lights and electronic devices on ( 62 % ) , or throw away things that could be recycled ( 61 % ) . And , sizeable minorities of environmentally conscious Americans are bothered a lot by people incorrectly putting trash in recycling bins ( 42 % ) or people driving places that are close enough to walk ( 34 % ) . The least irksome behavior is drinking from a disposable water bottle ; 23 % of environmentally conscious Americans say this bothers them a lot , compared with 12 % among those who are less focused on everyday environmentalism .
Only 2 % of U.S. adults say they have been officially diagnosed with COVID-19 by a health care provider , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . And 2 % say they have taken a blood test that showed they have COVID-19 antibodies , an indication that they previously had the coronavirus . But many more Americans ( 14 % ) say they are `` pretty sure '' they had COVID-19 , despite not getting an official diagnosis . And nearly four-in-ten ( 38 % ) say they 've taken their temperature to check if they might have the disease . Although few Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19 themselves , many more say they know someone with a positive diagnosis . More than one-in-four U.S. adults ( 28 % ) say they personally know someone who has been diagnosed by a health care provider as having COVID-19 . A smaller share of Americans ( 20 % ) say they know someone who has been hospitalized or who has died as a result of having the coronavirus .
By this measure , Americans place less importance on religion in their lives than do people in a number of countries in Africa , the Middle East and Asia . For example , nearly universal shares of Ethiopians ( 98 % ) , Senegalese ( 97 % ) and Indonesians ( 95 % ) say religion is very important , as do eight-in-ten or more Nigerians ( 88 % ) , Filipinos ( 87 % ) and Indians ( 80 % ) .
When asked to choose between the U.S. and China as the preferred leading power for the world , Americans clearly prefer their own country . But only 13 % of Russians choose the U.S. Nearly three times as many Russians prefer China ( 35 % ) over the U.S. , and a similar share of Russians volunteer `` neither , '' which might indicate displeasure with Russia not being offered as a category for this question .
Black Protestants , who overwhelmingly identify as Democrats or as Democratic-leaning independents , are the religious group with by far the most positive views toward Biden . Roughly half ( 54 % ) say he would make a good ( 34 % ) or great ( 20 % ) president , while 36 % say he would be an average president and just 8 % say he would be poor or terrible . Meanwhile , eight-in-ten Black Protestants say Trump has been a poor ( 16 % ) or terrible ( 63 % ) president .
The number of black journalists working at U.S. daily newspapers has dropped 40 % since 1997 , according to the latest data from the American Society of News Editors . That represents a loss of almost 1,200 journalists — from 2,946 in 1997 to 1,754 in 2013 . It 's also a steeper decline than the rate of job losses for white journalists — a 34 % decrease during the same time period . In the last 16 years , the ranks of Hispanic and Asian journalists have also declined , though not as steeply — losing 13 % and 2 % , respectively .
Americans broadly found it acceptable for the government to monitor certain people , but not U.S. citizens , according to the 2014 - 15 survey . About eight-in-ten adults ( 82 % ) said it was acceptable for the government to monitor communications of suspected terrorists , and equal majorities said it was acceptable to monitor communications of American leaders and foreign leaders ( 60 % each ) . Yet 57 % of Americans said it was unacceptable for the government to monitor the communications of U.S. citizens .
Fully 92 % of internet users agreed that the online environment allows people to be more critical of one another , compared with their offline experiences .

Even though many people in the nations surveyed say they want less immigration , there is considerable support for accepting both refugees who flee violence ( a median of 77 % ) and immigrants who are highly skilled ( 64 % ) . At the same time , large shares back deporting immigrants currently in the country illegally ( a median of 69 % ) . When asked if highly skilled people from other nations should be encouraged to move to their country , roughly half or more in eight of 10 European countries polled support this approach . Agreement with this policy ranges from 35 % in Italy to 88 % in Sweden .
If friendship is viewed as a step that could lead to marriage , it is easy to see why most Israelis say they oppose intermarriage . The vast majority of Jews ( 98 % ) , Muslims ( 85 % ) , Christians ( 86 % ) and Druze ( 83 % ) say that all or most of their close friends belong to their own religious community . Perhaps in part because they make up small percentages of Israel 's population , Muslims , Christians and Druze are more likely than Jews to say at least some of their close friends are from another group .
As smartphone access has become more prevalent , a growing share of teens now report using the internet on a near-constant basis . Some 45 % of teens say they use the internet `` almost constantly , '' a figure that has nearly doubled from the 24 % who said this in the 2014 - 2015 survey . Another 44 % say they go online several times a day , meaning roughly nine-in-ten teens go online at least multiple times per day .
Asked to report how often their personal religious beliefs conflict with science , a median of just one-in-ten say there is often conflict . A median of 31 % across the 20 publics surveyed say such conflict occurs at least sometimes . Majorities across most of these publics say there is rarely or never conflict between the two . But when people think about the broad idea of whether science and religion are at odds , larger shares see the two as being in conflict ( 20-public median of 53 % ) . That point of view is particularly common among people who do not identify with a religious group .
They were also much more likely to say the country needs to continue to make changes to ensure blacks have equal rights with whites . Fully eight-in-ten blacks ( 81 % ) said so , compared with just over a third ( 36 % ) of whites .
Nearly nine-in-ten Americans ( 87 % ) who have seen a health care provider in the past year say their concerns or descriptions of symptoms were carefully listened to , and 84 % say they felt their provider `` really cared about ( their ) health and well-being , '' according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in spring 2016 . Just 23 % of patients said they `` felt rushed by their health care provider , '' and even fewer ( 15 % ) felt confused about instructions they got for treatment or at-home care .
Around a third ( 36 % ) of legislators in the four countries who tweeted about Floyd 's killing and racism commented on the protests spreading across the U.S. About 30 % discussed Trump and his handling of the protests – with seven times as many posts critical , as opposed to supportive . In the UK , 32 % of British legislators who tweeted about Floyd or `` Black lives matter '' lobbied for banning tear gas , rubber bullets and riot gear sales from the UK to the U.S .
The public remained focused on the unfolding environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last week , while the media divided its attention between two top stories : the oil leak and controversial comments by Gen. Stanley McChrystal that led to his ouster as commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan . More than half of the public ( 53 % ) says they followed news about the Gulf coast oil leak more closely than any other major story . Just 7 % say they followed news about the general 's comments and resignation most closely , according to the latest News Interest Index survey conducted June 24 - 27 among 1,001 adults by the Pew Research Center .
The public continues to support the U.S. military campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria . But most Americans say the U.S. military effort against ISIS is not going well , and just 30 % think the U.S. and its allies have a `` clear goal '' in taking military action . The new national survey by the Pew Research Center , conducted Oct. 15 - 20 among 2,003 adults , finds that 57 % approve of the U.S. military campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria , while just 33 % disapprove . Support is highest among Republicans ( 68 % ) ; majorities of Democrats ( 54 % ) and independents ( 55 % ) also approve .

Only a median of 14 % across the 40 countries said that using contraceptives ( we did not specify exactly what kind of contraceptive ) was morally wrong , while 54 % said they personally believed it was acceptable . A further 21 % said it was not a moral issue . Only in Pakistan , Nigeria and Ghana did half or more say contraceptives were immoral .
